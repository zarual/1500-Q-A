        "question_ch": "九岁是什么感觉——这个年龄最好的地方是什么？",
        "answer_en": "As a nine-year-old I felt I stood on a threshold between childhood and something a little bigger. I could read weighty books like grown-ups and ask the kind of questions that made my parents pause; at the same time I still raced down the hill on my sled with my heart tumbling like I was four. Nine gave me enough freedom to wander the park with my binoculars, enough skill to fry my own breakfast, and enough confidence to launch my own experiments in Uncle Owen’s studio. I loved how simple moments—the first bite of a new lamb dish or the thrill of watching two parrot chicks hatch—felt like grand discoveries. I could trust my instincts to defend a friend or stand up to a bully, yet still confide in my mum when I saw something I couldn’t explain. At nine the world seemed full of paths to explore, each waiting for my own footprints and questions. That delicious mixture of curiosity, growing independence, and the comfort of home is, I think, the best thing about being nine.",
        "answer_ch": "作为九岁的小孩，我觉得自己站在童年和某种更大事物之间的门槛上。我可以像大人一样读厚重的书籍，提出让父母停下来思考的问题；同时，我还可以像四岁的小孩一样，心跳加速地在坡上滑雪橇。九岁给了我足够的自由，在公园里带着我的望远镜闲逛，足够的技巧自己煎早餐，还有足够的自信在欧文叔叔的工作室进行自己的实验。我喜欢那些简单的时刻——尝尝新羊肉菜肴的第一口，或者看着两只鹦鹉雏鸟孵化的兴奋——让我觉得像是伟大的发现。我可以信任自己的直觉来保护朋友或对抗欺凌者，但当我看到无法解释的事情时，仍然能够向妈妈倾诉。在九岁的时候，世界似乎充满了待我探索的道路，每条都是为了我的脚印和问题而等待的。我认为，九岁时那种好奇心、逐渐独立和家庭温暖的奇妙结合，是最美好的事情。"

        "question_ch": "当你想到成为一个男孩（或女孩）时，这对你意味着什么？",
        "answer_en": "When I think about being a boy, it feels more like a collection of experiences and choices than a list of rules. People often expect boys to play football, climb trees without fear, or hide their feelings, but I’ve learned to make my own path. I climb trees and fly kites because I love the view, not because it’s what boys “should” do. I help Dad cook breakfast and tinker with rockets because I’m curious, not because it’s a “boy thing.” I ask Mum hard questions about life and admit when I’m scared, even of spiders. Being a boy means having the freedom to follow what fascinates me—beetles, baking, art, science experiments—and the courage to speak up for others, like when a classmate needs help. To me, being a boy means being honest, generous, curious, and comfortable in my own skin, discovering who I truly want to be.",
        "answer_ch": "当我想到作为一个男孩时，这更像是一系列经历和选择，而不是一份规则清单。人们常常期望男孩们踢足球、无畏地爬树或隐藏自己的感受，但我学会了走自己的道路。我爬树和放风筝是因为我喜欢那种景色，并不是因为这是男孩“应该”做的事情。我帮爸爸做早餐和捣鼓火箭是因为我好奇，而不是因为这是“男孩的事”。我向妈妈提出有关生活的难题，并承认自己害怕，甚至是蜘蛛。成为男孩意味着有自由去追随我所着迷的事物——甲虫、烘焙、艺术、科学实验——还有勇气为他人发声，比如当同学需要帮助时。对我来说，做一个男孩意味着诚实、慷慨、好奇，并且对自己的身份感到舒适，发现我真正想成为什么样的人。"

        "answer_en": "I remember feeling so shy one March afternoon when I was asked to share my beetle survey at the school’s insect club. I’d spent weeks studying beetle diversity around my home—notes, sketches, even photos of a rainbow stag beetle—but as I stepped to the front of the lab classroom, my face burned and my hands trembled. All the club members—older students, parents and Mr Gupta—looked at me expectantly. My notebook slipped in my sweaty palm and my throat went dry. I forced myself to take a deep breath, recalled Dad’s advice to speak slowly and Aunt Irene’s calm voice, then introduced how I’d trapped and identified each species. My voice shook for the first few sentences, but when I showed the video of the stag beetle emerging from under a log and heard the applause, my shyness melted into relief and pride. By the end, I was answering questions as confidently as if I were in my own corner at Uncle Owen’s studio.",
        "answer_ch": "我记得在一个三月的下午，当我被要求在学校的昆虫俱乐部分享我的甲虫调查时，我感到非常害羞。我花了几周的时间研究我家周围的甲虫多样性——做了笔记、草图，甚至拍了彩虹角甲虫的照片——但当我走到实验室前面时，脸颊发烫，双手颤抖。所有的俱乐部成员——年长的学生、家长和古普塔先生——都期待地看着我。我的笔记本在我出汗的手心里滑落，喉咙变得干燥。我强迫自己深吸一口气，想起爸爸的建议，慢慢说话，以及艾琳姑姑的平静声音，然后介绍我如何捕捉和识别每个物种。刚开始的几句，我的声音颤抖，但当我展示角甲虫从原木下冒出来的视频并听到掌声时，我的害羞化为一种松了一口气的自豪感。到最后，我回答问题的信心就像在欧文叔叔的工作室里自己的角落一样。"

        "answer_en": "I loved whole-wheat toast slathered in Bonne Maman marmalade because I first tasted it after watching Paddington Bear and it felt like warming sunshine on a cold morning; its bittersweet tang and chewy crumb always reminded me of that spark of excitement when I first tried something new. I was also fond of my grandmother’s lamb soup with flatbread—its gentle spice and tender meat carried the comfort of her quiet Sunday afternoons in the Cotswolds, and every time I tasted it, I felt wrapped in her care. As for songs, I adored the Irish folk melody “Danny Boy” which Grace used to hum whenever she tended her garden; its slow, yearning tune made me think of misty hills and my great-grandmother Orla’s stories of spirits dancing under moonlight. And the Chinese tune “Mo Li Hua” became special when Chen Jia taught it to me—its simple, flowing melody felt like the sweet scent of jasmine that drifted through our kitchen when his mother cooked pao mo for us. In stories I loved Nezha’s legend from the film Nezha: Birth of the Demon Child, because his fearless spirit and willingness to stand up for what was right inspired me to be brave, and I cherished the little tales Orla told about the magic hidden in everyday fields and forests—those whispered legends of giants and fairies made me believe the world was full of secret wonders just waiting for me to discover.",
        "answer_ch": "我喜欢全麦吐司抹上Bonne Maman的果酱，因为我第一次尝试是在看《帕丁顿熊》之后，那感觉就像寒冷早晨里的温暖阳光；它的酸甜口感和嚼劲总让我想起第一次尝试新事物时那种激动的火花。我还喜欢奶奶的羊肉汤配扁面包——它温和的香料和嫩滑的肉带来了她在科茨沃尔德静谧的星期日下午的安慰，每次品尝时，我都感到被她的关爱包围。至于歌曲，我非常喜欢爱尔兰民谣《丹尼男孩》，格蕾丝一边照顾花园一边哼唱的旋律；那悠缓而渴望的曲调让我想起雾气弥漫的山丘，以及曾曾祖母奥尔拉关于精灵在月光下跳舞的故事。中国的曲子《茉莉花》在陈佳教我时变得特别——它简单流畅的旋律就像他妈妈为我们做泡馍时飘散在厨房里的茉莉花香。至于故事，我喜欢电影《哪吒：魔童降世》中的哪吒传说，因为他无畏的精神和坚守正义的意愿激励我勇敢，我珍惜奥尔拉讲述的关于日常田野和森林中隐藏的魔法的小故事——那些低语的巨人和仙女的传说让我相信这个世界充满了等待我去发现的秘密奇迹。"

I’ve learned French in my after-school club too—it feels smooth and soft, with gentle “r” sounds that roll on your tongue.

        "answer_en": "I had always felt like my magnifying glass was a piece of me; when I held it, I felt my curiosity focusing outward and inward at once, a bridge between me and the tiny wonders of the world. It was small, round, cool in my hand, but through its lens I had discovered insect legs as fine as hairs, the veins on a leaf like a golden river delta, even the sawdust on Uncle Owen’s wooden models looking like a desert. Carrying it everywhere made me feel confident, as if any mystery could be solved with a closer look. I connected it to my name, to Sir Isaac Newton’s notebooks where every small observation led to grand ideas, and I felt proud wearing that spirit around my neck. No matter how tall I grew or how many books I read, that magnifier reminded me that every great discovery began in the smallest details.",

I often extended my hand for a gentle handshake or, if the moment felt more relaxed, offered a brief nod and asked,“What’s your name?” before following up with a question about what they liked—science, art, or perhaps even the last book they’d read—so that our conversation could blossom from a genuine curiosity about each other.",

        "answer_en": "My parents often call me “their little gift from God” or even “my alchemist” when I’m cooking up experiments in the kitchen, which makes me feel cherished and proud, though I do blush at such lofty titles. Uncle Owen and Aunt Irene sometimes call me “a true artist” after they see me splattering paint in his studio, and their words fill me with a warm sense of belonging in the world of creativity. My best friend Gerald, whenever I help him with animals, has dubbed me “the animal expert,” which gives me both pride and a strong sense of responsibility, because I know he truly trusts my knowledge. Mom teases me as “my little chef” every morning, and that nickname makes me feel grown-up and capable in our home. At school some classmates shorten my name to “Ike” or jokingly call me “Newton baby,” which tickles me but also reminds me of the famous man I share my name with, making me a bit shy. Occasionally a few kids tease me as “Shorty” because I’m one of the smaller kids in class, and that nickname makes me feel self-conscious and embarrassed—yet it also spurs me to focus on my strengths beyond my height. In every nickname I hear a different reflection of myself, and that makes me feel seen, valued, and sometimes challenged to live up to the name.",
        "answer_ch": "我父母常常称我为“上帝的小礼物”，或者在我厨房做实验时叫我“我的炼金术士”，这让我感到被珍惜和自豪，尽管我对这样崇高的称呼会有些脸红。欧文叔叔和艾琳阿姨看我在他的工作室溅洒颜料后，有时会称我为“真正的艺术家”，他们的话让我感受到在创意世界中温暖的归属感。我的好朋友杰拉尔德在我帮助他照顾动物时，称我为“动物专家”，这让我感到自豪，也让我有强烈的责任感，因为我知道他真正信任我的知识。妈妈每天早上调侃我叫“我的小厨师”，这个昵称让我在家里感到成熟和能干。在学校里，一些同学把我的名字缩短为“Ike”或者开玩笑地叫我“牛顿宝宝”，这让我感到高兴，但也让我想起和我同名的那个著名人物，让我有些害羞。偶尔几个孩子叫我“矮个子”，因为我是班上较小的孩子之一，这个昵称让我感到自卑和尴尬——不过它也激励我去关注自己的长处，而不仅仅是身高。每一个昵称都让我听到不同的自我反射，这让我感到被看见、被重视，有时也让我感受到挑战，激励我活出这个名字的意义。"

I’d like them to remember me as someone who cared deeply about others—kind to my sister and friends, generous with my time and with what little I had, even if it was just sharing a cookie or a sketchbook. I hope they’d say I was honest and loyal, the kind of person who kept promises and stood up for what was fair. I’d love for them to call me an observer of the world, someone who noticed the tiniest details in nature and in people’s faces, and used those observations to paint pictures, build kites, or write stories.

My dad, a language teacher, pored over calendars and old records to confirm the dates, while my mum, a doctor, quietly mused that whether or not the apple story was true, naming me after one of history’s greatest natural philosophers would always remind me to stay curious about the world. I’ve asked my parents why they never added a middle name, and they say simplicity suits me—Isaac Newton, nothing more and nothing less.",

In that moment I discovered that the world had secrets deeper than any storybook, and it taught me that curiosity isn’t just an impulse—it’s the beginning of everything I want to learn and become.

Like her, I felt a relentless curiosity about the natural world; I, too, wanted to know why lightning crackled across the sky or how a tiny beetle could carry a thousand times its weight. She talked of her work with the earnestness of a poet and the precision of a scientist, and I realized that I shared her calm, careful patience when observing creatures or conducting experiments. Whenever she described sinking into data for days on end without tiring, I recognized that same thrill in myself when I lost track of time among my kites, my soap-making or my butterfly surveys. In Aunt Irene’s combination of disciplined logic and honest passion I saw the best of what I could become—and in those moments I felt proud to share a spark of her spirit.",

Whether I’m watching bees pollinate flowers in the garden, working out a new way to fold a kite, or translating a poem from Chinese, I bring the same curiosity and patience. My classmates mostly follow the class rules; I tend to ask why the rules exist and sometimes challenge them to see if there’s a better way. I’m comfortable juggling art supplies, a biology textbook and a cooking pan all in one day, and I like planning projects that cross different subjects—like combining geometry with baking or drawing insects in the Natural History Museum. I also take care of our rabbits and turtles, speak to my sister in Chinese while swapping jokes with my best friend Gerald in English. All those interests, languages and the way I can be serious without losing my sense of play make me different from the other children in class.",

Most of the time I speak at a steady, measured pace, careful to choose the right words, because I like precision. When I read aloud in class or share my insect findings, I feel a gentle buzzing in my throat and a warm flutter in my chest, as though ideas are lifting off inside me. If I’m nervous—like speaking in front of the whole school—it trembles ever so slightly, but once I settle into the topic, it grows steadier and stronger. Speaking feels like guiding a small current of air shaped by thought and feeling, and I always try to make it carry exactly what I mean.",

The word “Curiosity” captured how I kept asking questions about falling apples, fossils and the vast night sky, while “Flight” reminded me of my dream to soar like a bird or Falcon and see the world from above. I imagined the song opening with soft wind chimes like leaves rustling in Hampstead Heath, building into a lively piano and string melody that echoed my steady experiments in the kitchen or workshop and then swelled in moments of sudden discovery—spotting a rare butterfly or finding a hidden fossil. Its rising and falling would mirror my quiet patience and the rush of excitement that came with each new wonder. In my mind, “Curiosity’s Flight” would be a reminder that life is an adventure of questions, and every experiment, every walk in the park, every book or museum visit was a chance to lift off into something astonishing.",

What made me feel less afraid was knowing my mum and dad believed in me no matter how tall I became or how well—or poorly—I played sport. Hugs in the evenings reassured me they accepted my odd passions. Wandering Hampstead Heath with Leslie and Gerald, sketchbook and binoculars in hand, reminded me that the world still held secrets I was born to discover.

Here, surrounded by twisting branches and wildflowers, I watch woodpeckers tapping at the bark, dragonflies dancing over the pond, and bees burrowing into foxgloves. The air hums with life, and in that hum I’m entirely at ease—my thoughts sharpen, my curiosity soars, and I lose count of time as I sketch insects, jot down questions about tree rings and fungus, and plan experiments. No one’s watching, no rules intrude, and the garden’s endless green reminds me that discovery happens when you give yourself over to wonder. That oak, its roots like silent sentinels, is my sanctuary—where I’m most me.",

I’ve felt that same thrill each summer when I crouch by fossil beds or gaze at the Natural History Museum’s exhibits, and I sometimes wonder how she stayed so fearless and optimistic despite being ignored by many grown-ups.

I’m tickled by daft physical comedy too—tripping over my own shoelaces on Hampstead Heath, splattering paint in Owen’s studio and discovering an accidental masterpiece, or Lucien’s dramatic reactions to her Elsa dress.

In West London I can hop off a red double-decker bus or the Underground and find myself in immense green spaces within minutes: botanical wonders at Kew, rolling hills at Hampstead, even deer roaming in Richmond Park not far away. The River Thames threads its way through the city and every bridge tells a story of trade and empire. People here speak dozens of languages, and you can taste curries from Bangladesh, pastries from France, dim sum from China and Ethiopian coffee all in one afternoon. Museums—natural history, science, art—stand open to anyone curious enough to wander in. We have traditions too: Sunday roasts, Remembrance Day’s two-minute silence, fireworks on Guy Fawkes Night, the cheerful chaos of Notting Hill Carnival.

        "answer_en": "My bedroom walls are painted pale blue with a broad stripe of soft green around the middle, colors I chose because they remind me of the sky and the grass when I watch clouds at Hampstead Heath; above my bed hangs a row of miniature kites I’ve built in different shapes—swallow-style, box kites and even a tiny parafoil—strung on nylon so they flutter slightly whenever I open the window. On one side of the room stands my tall white bookshelf, packed with nature guides, encyclopedias, and The Wind in the Willows, while on the other side sits a sturdy tool bench where I keep my magnifier, screwdrivers, tins of specimens and art supplies in neat rows. My desk is littered with colored pencils and sketches of ichthyosaurs, with a 24-hour clock, a small globe, and my binoculars perched at the corner. Near the bookshelf, I’ve set up my gecko terrarium and a shallow tank for guppies and Colonel Rock the turtle—each home is decorated with bark, stones, and miniature branches I collected on Hampstead Heath. My play area in the corner holds Rummikub and Snakes & Ladders on a low table, a chemistry set stored in wooden boxes, and a cooking station with toy pots and pans where I practice simple recipes before I actually make breakfast downstairs. A purple beanbag faces a low window so I can sit and read or watch birds, and above it is pinned a hand-drawn map of Dinosaur Isle alongside a poster of the night sky from my first trip to the Natural History Museum. All these things—my kites, my field gear, my books and jars—make the room unmistakably mine.",

A few steps farther, at the end of our street, was the neighborhood playground: a climbing frame, swings, a wavy slide and a sandbox. I spent many afternoons there with my binoculars and notebook, sketching ants marching into the anthill at the oak’s roots or watching sparrows dart among the blossoms. On sunny days I launched my kite from the lawn, savoring the tug on the string; in spring I bent close to inspect newly sprouted seedlings and butterflies sipping nectar; in summer I lay on the grass, tracing the shapes of clouds above; and in autumn I gathered fallen acorns to study their caps under my magnifier.

Across the street lived Mrs. Patel and her collie, Baxter, who would bound into our yard whenever I coaxed Sophie into a game of fetch—each time Baxter returned my thrown stick I felt like I’d tamed a wolf of the wild. Along the garden wall I also counted a troop of grey squirrels—I’d sit very still with Sophie by my side, notebook in hand, sketching their acrobatics and even sharing handfuls of nuts (carefully wrapped in my handkerchief) until they trusted me enough to nibble from my palm. On Sundays, when Sophie and I weren’t exploring the squirrels or rallying Baxter, we baked “expedition biscuits” in my kitchen—Sophie taught me how to scone-cut rounds of dough into perfect circles, and then we’d pack them into a picnic hamper to fuel our next great adventure: a secret fort in my backyard made of old sheets, blankets and my set of 24 coloured pencils.

Neat hedges and flowering shrubs spill onto the pavements, and in spring the cherry blossoms in my neighbour’s garden drift pale pink petals across the tarmac. On weekends you might hear the distant laughter of families or the patter of dogs’ paws, but it still feels calm. A few cafés and bookshops tuck into the corners, their verandas shaded by ivy, and I pass the old stone church and its red pillar box on my way to school.

On Hampstead Heath I always head for the clearing just behind Kenwood House beside the lily pond, where fallen oak leaves lie on damp soil and I can find acorns, curious pieces of sandstone and even the occasional polished glass shard from long-ago picnickers; I like it because the woods are thick there and almost nobody visits so I can crouch quietly and study each leaf shape without interruption. My second favourite is the Serpentine’s stony shore near the Italian Gardens in Hyde Park, where I search for smooth river-worn pebbles and old brick fragments left by Victorian builders; I love it because it feels like hunting for fossils and makes me imagine mighty rivers and steam trains shaping the land. Finally, I sometimes walk to Richmond Park close to Isabella Plantation, where I gather fern fronds and strange seed pods—these feel magical because the plants there look as if they sprung from fairy tales.

I help care for the fish by feeding them twice a day, testing and changing a quarter of the water weekly, and scraping algae off the sides. For Colonel Rock I clean his water dish, offer fresh greens and watch the water temperature. With the geckos I mist their tank daily, replace damp hides and feed them crickets or mealworms. I clean out the rabbit hutch, top up hay and vegetables, and refresh their water. The parrots get chopped fruit and fresh water every morning, and I train them to perch on my shoulder so I can check their feathers and beaks. The beetles must have moist wood and fruit slices, which I replace and keep their soil clean.

My first thought is to stay safe—so I unplug my microscope and computer, move away from windows, and help Mum light a battery‐powered lantern and some candles she keeps in the kitchen. Dad reminds me never to touch the windowsill during a storm because of the electricity in the air, and I fold my handkerchief into a little pouch for my pocket, just in case. Once we’re settled in the living room, with the turtle tank and gecko enclosures powered by our emergency LED lamp, I like to grab my notebook and 24‐colour pencils and sketch the lightning flashes I see through the windows—timing each flash and clap of thunder to calculate how far away the storm is, just like a little scientist. If I’m feeling adventurous I’ll record the rainfall in my rain gauge, but usually I’m content to read an astronomy book by torchlight, play Rummikub with Mum, or challenge Dad to Snakes & Ladders. Sometimes Lucy wants to hear one of my storm stories—I describe how clouds build up static electricity, or why rainbows can follow storms—and she listens wide-eyed until her eyelids get heavy. And if the rain lets up before the power returns, I slip on my wellies and dash into the backyard under an umbrella to splash in puddles while Dad waves his torch, making sure I stay close. By the time the lights come back on, I’ve not only stayed safe but also turned a stormy evening into an adventure.",

Behind our back fence a small rowan tree sprouted white clusters in spring, turned into dark berries for the birds each autumn and stood bare by December except for its bright orange jewels. In our front garden my mother tended a lavender bush that filled the evening air with perfume between May and September, and I spotted crocus and daffodils pushing through the frost in early March. Ivy clung to the old brick wall all year, shining in winter rain, while a single apple sapling by the shed grew tiny green apples through summer that slowly reddened by August. I kept a notebook to record when every leaf unfurled or fell, because I loved seeing the same plants change so many times in a single year.",

From next door came the muffled voices of Mrs. Zhang setting out tea cups for her morning ritual, and sometimes I caught Mr. Thompson’s low laugh when he chatted through his kitchen door on the way to work. The mixture of nature and city stirred me gradually—first the birds coaxed my eyelids to open, and then the soft mechanical thrum of traffic nudged me fully awake.

Farther still the green sweep of Hampstead Heath rose like a softly undulating sea of trees, broken by a distant playground where I sometimes spotted Gerald and his little sister on the swings.

The sandbox became our fossil dig site—Lucy buried her toy dinosaurs in neat rows so I could practice excavating them with a paintbrush and magnifier, while I mapped their “skeletons” in my notebook and Gerald pretended they were ichthyosaur bones. The trampoline was my laboratory for gravity experiments: I measured each bounce’s duration and tried throwing somersaults, always landing on my feet. On drizzly days we still played under the little playhouse roof attached to the climbing frame, reenacting scenes from The Hobbit or planning archaeological expeditions across the “jungle” of our ivy-covered fence.

I cross the quiet street where the number 46 bus stops and head up the slight hill, passing the corner bakery whose ovens smell of fresh bread, and the little café where Dad and I sometimes have afternoon tea. Along the pavement I often spot a fat grey squirrel darting across the road or a robin perched on a lamppost, singing. A few doors down is the florist with its window full of bright chrysanthemums and tulips; beyond that a small newsagent sells postcards of Hampstead Heath and the zoo. Just before the crossing lights I see Gerald’s penguin hat bobbing ahead of me—he’s usually on his way home from school. At the end of the road I turn right onto Englands Lane and there it is: the Sainsbury’s shopfront, with its bright green sign and glass windows stacked with apples and carrots. Inside I walk down the aisles of organic veg, pick up a loaf of whole-wheat bread, grab my favourite Bonne Maman marmalade from the jam shelf, and head to the till, passing the ready-made lamb soup I like to try in winter.

The houses—red-brick terraces with arched windows—turned solemn and quiet, their curtains drawn as families settled in for tea. Occasionally I spotted a lone jogger in neon running gear or heard Sophie calling “Hello!” from her flat as she locked her door. The air smelled faintly of damp earth and autumn leaves, and sometimes a distant whiff of someone’s dinner—roast lamb or spicy curry—drifted by.

Each stop we passed released a hiss of air brakes and a chorus of footfalls, and I counted the old brick houses slipping by, trying to imagine which one might hide a hidden world indoors. I watched people waiting at the bus shelters—some with umbrellas, some with smiling dogs—while the heater clicked on and warmed my toes. At Piccadilly Circus the bus shuddered under the weight of the city’s lights and voices; the neon signs reflected on wet pavement, making streaks of vermilion and emerald that looked like spilled paint. Daddy caught my eye and nodded, his smile as steady as the driver’s hand on the wheel, and I understood that this ordinary, noisy ride was its own kind of adventure.

All those sounds mix into a strangely soothing lullaby, neither too loud nor perfectly quiet, so that before long I’m drifting off, feeling as if I’m falling asleep inside a warm, busy world rather than a silent room.",

Every evening I empty the brown caddy into our big compost bin in the garden, where Dad turns the pile of compost every week so it breaks down into rich soil we use for Mom’s flower beds. On recycling day I wheel the blue, green, and yellow bins to the curb—sometimes I help by flattening cereal boxes and rinsing out yoghurt pots so they’re clean.

But we do argue—most often because she grabs my magnifying glass or refuses to share my colored pencils—and her screeches can be ear-splitting. She’s stronger than she looks and once pinned me in a mock “wrestling match” until I begged for mercy. Still, she never holds a grudge: before I’ve even finished fuming she’ll run up, throw her arms around me, and demand we play “robot buddies” or go look for bugs in the garden.

I also have a cousin Alex, who lives nearby with his mum and their Labrador Duke, and when he comes over we build things together in my uncle Owen’s studio or go for nature walks on Hampstead Heath, spotting squirrel nests or collecting fallen oak leaves for my art projects.

In spring we celebrate Easter by visiting the Natural History Museum to see the new dinosaur fossils and then picnic on Hampstead Heath; in late April our whole school bursts into Art Week, so I help sell lamb paomo at the food market Dad and I prepare, and we all dress up in costumes for the big exhibition on the lawn. On Mother’s Day I press fresh azalea blooms into bookmarks for Mum, and at each end-of-month Sunday Roast with cousins and aunts I eagerly trade homemade blueberry scones for Aunt Audrey’s Japanese floral arrangements.

        "answer_en": "My favorite family recipe was the Xi’an-style lamb pao mo, a hearty lamb-and-bread soup I learned to make from my friend Gerald’s mom, Jessica Wu. I still remember the Saturday she arrived with a suitcase of flatbread and huge lamb bones, and guided me step by step: how to simmer the bones with garlic, cinnamon, star anise and peppercorns until the broth turned rich and fragrant; how to tear the flatbread into irregular shreds so it soaked up the soup without turning to mush; how to stir in julienned lamb, fresh cilantro and spring onions just before serving. Watching Jessica’s calm confidence as she ladled steaming bowls for the family felt like magic, and when Dad took that first spoonful and closed his eyes in delight, I knew I had mastered something very special.",
        "answer_ch": "我最喜欢的家庭食谱是西安风味的羊肉泡馍，这是一道丰盛的羊肉和面包汤，我是从朋友杰拉尔德的妈妈吴杰西卡那里学会的。我仍然记得那个星期六，她带着一箱 flatbread 和巨大的羊骨来到我家，手把手教我：如何用大蒜、肉桂、八角和胡椒粒慢炖羊骨，直到汤料变得浓郁芬芳；如何将 flatbread 撕成不规则的碎片，这样它就能吸收汤汁而不变得糊状；如何在上菜前搅拌切丝的羊肉、新鲜的香菜和葱。在她为家人盛汤的过程中，看到杰西卡的冷静自信就像在看魔法，当爸爸尝第一口，闭上眼睛享受时，我知道我掌握了某种非常特别的东西。"

I’d state calmly what bothered me and listen to Luthien’s point of view, and by the end we usually discovered a compromise that made us both happy—she’d paint the clouds and I’d do the rainbow—and we never stayed upset for long.",

        "question_ch": "当你家里有人不高兴时，其他人是如何安慰他们的——谁先主动提供支持？",
        "answer_en": "In our house it’s usually Mum who is first to notice when one of us is feeling low, and she instinctively takes the lead in comforting them. She’ll sit beside us, gently ask what’s wrong and offer hugs or a warm hand-hold, then use her natural empathy to listen without judgment. If it’s a younger child—like Luthien after a playground fall—Mum will swoop in almost before the tears have dry and distract them with a story or soft song. When it’s me or Dad who’s upset, she’ll still be the one to say “Tell me about it,” and really hear me out.  \nDad’s support comes next: he’s quieter about feelings but very steady. He’ll gently offer practical help—fixing a broken toy, driving me somewhere, or simply standing by in silence until I’m ready to talk. Then he’ll share his perspective, often turning the problem into a small “we’ll-solve-it-together” project.  \nMy big sister Audrey jumps in bravely if she thinks someone’s been treated unfairly—she’ll defend us without a second’s hesitation—and Uncle Owen gives us space when we need it, leaving out tools or art materials so we can work through our feelings by creating. Irene, my other aunt, will calmly talk us through the facts, helping us see a situation in a more logical light. Even cousins and friends like Gerald or Sophie know exactly what to say or do—sometimes a quick game, a silly joke, or an offer of afternoon tea. So although everyone has their own way of comfort, Mum is always at the heart of it, making sure no one has to face their upset alone.",
        "answer_ch": "在我们家，通常是妈妈最先注意到我们中的某个人情绪低落，她本能地主动安慰他们。她会坐在我们旁边，轻声询问发生了什么，并提供拥抱或温暖的握手，然后用她天生的同理心倾听而不加评判。如果是较小的孩子，比如卢西恩在游乐场摔倒后，妈妈几乎在眼泪还未干时就会扑过来，用故事或柔和的歌曲来分散他们的注意力。当我或爸爸感到沮丧时，她仍然会是那个说“跟我说说”的人，并真正倾听我。  \n接下来是爸爸的支持：他在情感方面比较沉默，但非常稳重。他会温和地提供实际帮助——修理坏掉的玩具、送我去某个地方，或者只是静静地陪着我，直到我准备好谈话。然后他会分享他的看法，常常把问题变成一个小小的“我们一起解决”的项目。  \n我的姐姐奥德丽如果觉得有人受到不公平对待，会勇敢地出面——她毫不犹豫地为我们辩护——而欧文叔叔在我们需要空间时，会给我们留出一些工具或艺术材料，让我们通过创作来理清情绪。我的另一个姑姑艾琳会冷静地和我们分析事实，帮助我们以更逻辑的视角看待情况。即使是表亲和朋友，比如杰拉尔德或苏菲，也知道该说什么或做什么——有时候是快速的游戏、一个傻乎乎的笑话，或者下午茶的邀请。所以，尽管每个人都有自己安慰的方式，妈妈总是处于中心，确保没有人要独自面对他们的难过。"

Alongside that, Dad—who taught Chinese at school—insisted on speaking Mandarin with me from my first Chinese picture-book lesson; he read me fairy tales in Mandarin every evening and corrected my tones whenever we pretended to be pandas in the garden. Because John Chen lived with us as well, I practised Mandarin constantly with him after school, and when I got stuck Dad would help me sort out characters and pronunciation. Mum, who had studied French at university and loved European travel, taught me my first French words—she’d coax me into singing “Frère Jacques” at tea time and corrected my “bonjour” with a gentle smile. Uncle Ian’s American wife Angela, during her visits, slipped me cheery “hola” and “adiós” from her Spanish lessons, and soon I was mixing a few Spanish words into my morning greetings. When Aunt Audrey came home from her two years in Japan—and brought back not just flower-arranging skills but a new way of seeing the world—she patiently taught me my first Japanese phrases: “ohayō” for good morning and “arigatō” for thank you, which I practiced over bowls of miso soup. Even Uncle Samira’s Persian “salaam” crept into our hallways when she visited, so I know a little Farsi greeting too. And at Grandma Grace’s house in the Cotswolds I heard her soft Irish brogue, picked up phrases like “grand” and “right eejit,” and learned to love the musical lilt of her accent as part of my everyday world.",

Uncle Owen sent over my sketchbook to record wildflowers in the garden, and Dad let me bring my binoculars so I could birdwatch on the misty meadows. Lucy clutched her favourite doll for company. Each day we explored new fields, gathered eggs from the henhouse, swung on an old oak tree in the mist, and then gathered inside for scones and hot chocolate.

On weekends, especially for stargazing or an art project in Owen’s studio, I’d remind my parents of my responsible track record—always tidying my room, cooking my own breakfast, tending my beetles—and sometimes they let me stay up until 10 p.m. or have an extra hour on my tablet.

Then on the next Sunday Roast at Grandma and Grandpa’s, they’d raise their glasses of orange juice to toast “to our young naturalist,” and Uncle Owen or Aunt Irene might bring a small gift—a new set of paints or a book on astronomy—so that I felt their pride and encouragement for the whole week ahead.",

Until then he’d always seemed angry and unapproachable, but the moment he spoke those words the whole family went silent and I saw Grandma’s face drain of colour and Dad’s eyes fill with tears. Mum didn’t let us pretend everything was normal—she gathered us around the table, hugged Rupert gently and told him how much we loved him, while Aunt Irene cried and Dad quietly promised to help with whatever he needed. Over the next weeks we visited him at the hospital, helped Grandma cook his favourite meals, let him talk about anything he wanted and made sure he never felt alone. That time taught me that even the toughest person needs their family, and that sharing fear, hope and love together was the strongest way we could support each other.",

I wrote real letters or postcards to Grandma and Grandpa in the Cotswolds almost every month, tucking in pressed wildflowers or simple sketches of the insects I’d spotted around Hampstead Heath; once or twice a year I even sent longer handwritten rounds to my great-aunt in Ireland, recounting summer adventures like sailing a homemade raft on a creek or the latest kite-flying triumph. For my Chinese exchange brother John’s family, we did a video call every fortnight—Sunday evenings were our ritual; he’d show me his new geography maps and I’d give him a tour of my pet beetles under the bright lamp. Between those, I phoned Uncle Ian in America on his son Alex’s birthdays and holidays, keeping our voices familiar; Aunt Samira in London got surprise voice-message recordings of me singing silly nature jingles or describing a new recipe I’d tested, which always made her laugh. At Christmas and Chinese New Year, we exchanged e-cards and small parcels—her homemade yum cha sauce, my hand-painted wooden shoji bookmark—so there was something physical to open and treasure. And whenever grandparents retired to the suburbs, Dad drove me to visit them roughly once a month for Sunday Roast and long, real-face conversations over tea.

My sister Lucien and I would scramble down slippery rocks at low tide, poking into rock pools full of crabs and anemones while Dad sketched their shapes in his notebook. One sunlit afternoon we hiked to Durdle Door, where sheer limestone arches rose from the turquoise water, and I felt so small and excited I nearly sang out loud. We tried kayaking in a sheltered cove, but I capsized and learned, with Dad’s patient help, how to climb back into the kayak—his quiet pride when I finally balanced made me feel grown-up. Best of all was our day on the Jurassic Coast hunting fossils: every flint shard or jagged bone fragment felt like a treasure from 200 million years ago.

But it’s tricky too—there’s more homework than before, especially when Mr Bosworth insists we “follow all the rules” to the letter, and sometimes I struggle to balance my chores (like making breakfast) with study and play; I’m also learning to manage my time so I don’t miss my weekly entomology survey or let my geckos’ breeding efforts fall behind. And of course I’m a little nervous about moving to Year 3 in September—will I find a teacher as inspiring as Ms MacFarlane, or will I face another “strict and rigid” instructor?

She listened to my endless questions about insects and invited me to share my discoveries with the school Insect Club. In her class I never felt boxed in by rules—she simply asked us to take responsibility for our work and explore our own ideas—so I spent more time painting, building models and writing stories than I ever had before.

When we finally flew our kite together on Hampstead Heath, I saw how proud he was—his shy smile stretched into a laugh as the kite dipped and soared.

From watching beetles crawl in my backyard to stirring up new recipes in the kitchen, every experiment—whether it was observing how plants drink water through colored stems or launching paper rockets in the park—helped me understand scientific ideas without feeling like hard work. I could see cause and effect, ask “why” and “how,” and then test ideas with my own hands or tools, which turned lessons on forces, habitats, and simple chemistry into exciting puzzles. Because I was always jotting down notes in my nature notebook, sketching diagrams of insect anatomy or the phases of the moon, I mastered the methods of observation and recording early on. That habit made reading a textbook almost redundant—I already knew most principles from real-world encounters—so science always came naturally and, best of all, felt like play.",

        "answer_en": "Recently I worked on an art installation for our school’s Art Week called “Contact,” an interactive tunnel made of thin white paper stretched over a simple frame so visitors could step inside and feel surrounded by light and shadow. I planned the concept with my friend Maeve, drawing inspiration from the way Hassel’s presence feels—mysterious yet inviting—and we gathered rolls of calligraphy paper, bamboo sticks, and masking tape. We experimented with small-scale models in Owen’s studio, tested light sources to achieve a soft glow, and adjusted the paper’s curvature so the tunnel felt both fragile and strong. Over several afternoons we measured, cut, taped, and retaped until the structure was stable and the light reflections just right. Through this assignment I learned the value of patience, precision, and teamwork, and discovered that art isn’t only about creating pretty images but about shaping an experience that lets people walk into your imagination. Seeing classmates pause in wonder inside the tunnel and ask about our inspiration made me feel truly proud.",
        "answer_ch": "最近我为我们学校的艺术周创作了一个名为“接触”的艺术装置，这是一条用薄白纸拉伸在简单框架上的互动隧道，让参观者可以走进去，感受到光与影的包围。我和我的朋友梅芙一起规划了这个概念，从哈塞尔的存在给人的神秘而又亲切的感觉中汲取灵感，我们收集了卷轴的书法纸、竹棍和胶带。在欧文的工作室中，我们实验了小规模模型，测试光源以达到柔和的光辉，并调整纸张的曲度，使隧道既显得脆弱又坚固。在几个下午的时间里，我们测量、裁剪、粘贴、再重新粘贴，直到结构稳定、光的反射效果刚好。通过这个任务，我学到了耐心、精确和团队合作的价值，发现艺术不仅仅是创造美丽的图像，更是塑造一种让人们走入你想象中的体验。看到同学们在隧道中驻足惊叹并询问我们的灵感，让我感到非常自豪。"

        "answer_en": "I usually begin by making a simple plan in my notebook: I write the test date at the top and list the topics I need to master. For definitions or vocabulary I draw tiny flashcards on index cards—one term per card, with a quick mnemonic or little sketch on the back—so I can quiz myself anywhere, even in the car. For formulas or sequences I turn them into a short rhyme or song, because music helps me remember more than just rote repetition. I also ask Gerald or Leslie to join me for a brief study game: we split the flashcards into piles and take turns being the “quizmaster,” which makes learning feel like play rather than chore. If I get stuck on a concept—for example, a tricky science principle or a math problem—I jot it down in a special “questions” section of my notebook and ask Mrs. MacFarlane or my science teacher after class; they always explain it with a real‐life example until I feel confident. The night before a test I review my flashcards one more time and summarize each topic in two quick sentences in my own words. This combination of planning, self‐testing, peer review, and teacher help usually means I’m ready—and not too stressed—on the big day.",

And whenever a project called for equal effort—such as cooking our lamb paomo at the school food market—I divided tasks evenly with classmates: one person sliced vegetables, another stirred the stew, another served customers while I counted portions.

When they shouted out answers or wiggled too much, I had to hush softly but firmly, reminding them of our “listening ears,” which made me feel like a real teacher. Afterwards we drew pictures of spiders and pigs, and helping each child find their best colour match showed me how encouraging a few kind words could make them beam with pride. By the end of the hour I was exhausted but exhilarated—teaching them patience and focus taught me even more about my own.",

        "answer_en": "The biggest challenge I’ve faced in school this year was a sudden, overwhelming sense of boredom and restlessness that crept into every lesson, even my favorite science class, leaving me unable to focus or care about any of my usual projects. At first I felt guilty for not enjoying my work, and that only made me more anxious, so I spoke honestly with Mum and Dad about how dull everything felt. Mum suggested I embrace the boredom instead of fighting it, and Dad invited me to join him on early‐morning jogs in the park. Running beside him, breathing in fresh air, gave me space to think without pressure, and I realized my mind needed rest and new kinds of stimulation. I also reconnected with my hobbies—hopping over to Uncle Owen’s studio to experiment with art, spending weekends watching butterflies in Hampstead Heath, and cataloguing beetles in my notebook—and slowly my natural curiosity returned. By alternating periods of focused rest, exercise, and hands‐on exploration, I learned that boredom can be a signal to change pace, not proof that I’ve lost my passion.",

After school I first finished any online lessons or research I needed for homework—usually between 15:50 and 17:30—then I closed my laptop and left it on the desk. I’d help Mum or Dad with a quick chore—folding laundry or feeding the fish—before my “fun screen time.” From 19:30 to 20:00 I could play a game or watch an episode of my favorite science show, then I’d switch off all devices, pack away my tablet and phone, and spend the last hour before bed drawing, reading, or listening to music. Using alarms as boundaries and doing a small physical task in between helped me stop one kind of screen time and start the next.

She’s the first teacher who truly noticed my fascination with insects and encouraged me to share what I know with the school’s insect club. Rather than simply giving me answers, she asks gentle questions that make me think a little harder and then praises my curiosity, reminding me that science is more than facts—it’s a journey of discovery. Because of her, I’ve grown bolder in class, confident enough to propose my own mini-research projects, and I feel proud that my interest in bugs is valued rather than dismissed.",

My notebooks lived upright in magazine holders on my desk, each labelled with bold coloured tape for Language, Math, Science and so on, which let me slide the one I wanted forward in a flash. My calculator stayed in a soft pouch in the front pocket of my backpack, and I always packed it last, so I felt its weight as a signal to tuck it safely in before zipping up.

After that, whenever I planned a science experiment or painted in Uncle Owen’s studio, I asked myself if I was ready to take responsibility for whatever happened—even if things didn’t go perfectly. That lesson taught me far more than any formula: it taught me to trust myself, accept mistakes as part of growing up and always stand by my actions.",

When you completed a full skeleton you earned an Expedition Medal, but you could also draw “Dinosaur Cards” that triggered events like “Storm Erosion” or “Volcano Ash,” which would reshuffle layers on other players’ sites. The sand would wash away easily under the tap, the fossil pieces would be made of safe plaster so you could paint them afterward with a set of paints or coloured pencils, and a fold-out map would let you fossil-hunt in sites from Dorset to the Gobi Desert. I’d play with Gerald and Leslie by racing to uncover skeletons, trading fragments when we had extras, then studying the details through the loupe and inventing stories about how our dinosaurs lived.

It wasn’t just about following instructions but researching real carrier design—learning why the hull shape matters for stability in rough seas, how steam-catapult launch systems work, and how a carrier’s island must be carefully positioned for airflow. By the end we had assembled and painted every tiny part, and when I stood back and saw a 70 cm long replica of a warship I’d studied in books and documentaries, I felt proud of how patience, precision and a bit of engineering research can turn hundreds of plastic pieces into something I almost felt could sail.",

        "answer_en": "I like Rummikub best because it feels like a live puzzle where every move matters. When I play, I first sort my tiles by color and by number so I can see runs and groups at a glance. I watch closely what tiles my opponents pick up and what they discard—if someone hesitates before discarding a “5,” for instance, I know they might be collecting that number. I keep a joker tucked away until the perfect moment, since it can stand in for any missing tile. I also look for opportunities to split existing runs on the table: if there’s a run of 3-4-5-6 I might insert my own 4 and 6 to form two new runs, earning extra points. Sometimes I play a small set early to free up tiles in my rack, then patiently build toward a big finish. By paying attention to others’ moves and holding back just enough, I’ve often been able to play all my tiles in one thrilling turn and win the game.",
        "answer_ch": "我最喜欢 Rummikub，因为它感觉像一个每一步都至关重要的实时拼图。当我玩的时候，首先会按颜色和数字对我的牌进行分类，这样我可以一眼就看到顺子和组。我会密切关注对手捡起什么牌和丢弃什么牌——例如，如果有人在丢弃一张“5”之前犹豫，我就知道他们可能在收集那个数字。我会将一个白板藏起来，直到最佳时机，因为它可以代替任何缺失的牌。我还会寻找机会拆分桌面上已有的顺子：如果有一个3-4-5-6的顺子，我可能会插入我自己的4和6，形成两个新的顺子，从而获得额外的分数。有时我会早早打出一小组牌，以腾出我的牌架中的牌，然后耐心地朝着大结局发展。通过关注其他人的动作并保持适度的保留，我常常能够在一个令人兴奋的回合中打出所有牌，赢得比赛。"

Players took turns choosing one attribute to compare, and the higher value won the trick and captured the opponent’s card. After each round everyone drew back up to five until the deck ran out. I added special action cards: “Rainstorm” forced everyone to discard and redraw three cards, “Nightfall” let you hide one beetle from challenges for a turn, and “Predator” stole the highest beetle in play.

Hide-and-seek is fun for practicing patience and observation, and I also enjoy inventing scavenger hunts in Hampstead Heath where each hidden clue turns the park into a new realm of exploration, but capture the flag remains my favourite for that rush of adrenaline and the thrill of outwitting the other team.",

I sketched a simple map of the Heath and marked safe zones and off-limits areas near the golf course and main roads. Then I suggested a twenty-minute time limit and asked my friends if that felt fair; when they thought it too short to find the rarer species, we extended it to thirty minutes. To ensure no one panicked, we agreed to work in two teams, stay within sight of each other, and prove our finds with photographs rather than capturing any insects. I tested the list one afternoon and managed to spot seven species in twenty-five minutes, so I knew the rules would work. On the day, we met beneath the old oak, I read aloud the rules I’d neatly written in my notebook, and we set off, laughing whenever someone squealed at a flash of orange or cheered at a rare sighting. In the end I edged ahead with twenty-three points, but what really mattered was how much fun we all had exploring, learning together, and discovering new corners of the Heath.",

A run is at least three consecutive numbers in the same color (for example, red 5-6-7) and a group is at least three identical numbers in different colors (for example, three sevens in red, blue and black). The first time you play tiles your meld must total at least thirty points, adding the numbers on your tiles, but after that you can add tiles to any existing run or group on the table or even rearrange the tiles as long as every set remains valid.

My first audience was Lucienne, curled up on the rug beside me, then Dad and Mum who paused their chores to watch, and finally a few classmates—Leslie, Maeve, even Gerald—who squeezed into our living room during a rainy Saturday afternoon. They leaned forward when my voice whispered “dig, dig,” gasped when the ichthyosaur emerged in shadow, and clapped so loudly I almost knocked over the lamp.

I also tried the ukulele during an after-school club and discovered how pressing one string just so changes the chord completely. More recently I tapped on the djembes in our music room and learned that rhythm could connect me to my own heartbeat and to the natural pulse of a piece of music. Each instrument showed me a different part of music’s magic: melody on the keyboard, harmony on the ukulele and the power of rhythm on the drums.

Opposite, I built a low bookshelf for my nature guides and my cooking books, with hooks above for hanging a magnifying-glass station and jars of insects I’d safely collected nearby. A pulley and canvas bucket system let me hoist picnic supplies or art materials up without climbing. I painted a chalkboard strip near the railing for scribbling equations or reminders to water the tiny planter boxes I’d built into the railing for moss and wildflowers.

Each team had five players, two pilots flying specially designed kites with soft mesh pockets on their trailing spars, two runners carrying colored foam balls, and one referee‐judge to watch wind speed and timing. On “serve,” a runner tossed a foam ball into the air while his pilot caught it in the kite’s mesh. The pilot then guided the ball downwind toward the opponent’s goal zone—two tall poles supporting a horizontal hoop in the air. Opponents tried to intercept by maneuvering their kites to nudge the ball off course or pass it wisely between their own pilot and runner. To score, a team had to pass the ball through the aerial hoop without dropping it. Each successful “sky‐hoop” earned three points; ground hand‐offs between kite and runner earned one point. A match lasted four 10‐minute quarters, with wind checks every 15 minutes to keep conditions fair. Equipment consisted of lightweight kites built from carbon rods and nylon sails, detachable mesh pockets, color‐coded foam balls, anemometers for fair play, and safety helmets and goggles for all pilots.

Every half-inch I nudged the beetle forward, snapped a photo on our phone, then moved him again, over and over until I had about 200 frames. I even borrowed my sister’s small LED to make the mushroom glow in a dark room, so when the beetle finally reached it, the light would feel magical. Cutting the frames together with simple software, I added soft cricket sounds and a gentle violin melody.

Along the edges I’d stencil fern fronds in forest green to remind me of the ferns at Kew Gardens, and across the centre I’d add a thin stripe of sunset orange like a horizon line at dusk. For the grip tape on top I’d pick a translucent emerald that sparkles with gold flecks and pattern it with faint outlines of my favourite insects—a beetle here, a dragonfly there, a honeybee—so every ride feels like gliding through a starry forest. The wheels would be milky white with transparent cores so they catch and refract light like shards of frost.

I learned that repeating the same block or strike hundreds of times wasn’t boring but a way to train both body and mind to work together, to stay patient and precise.

        "answer_en": "I usually spent about an hour on screens each school day—half an hour after homework watching a BBC nature documentary or an episode of Doctor Who, then another half hour on my Nintendo Switch or iPad. On weekends I allowed myself up to two or even three hours, splitting that time between cartoons like How to Train Your Dragon or Inside Out, episodes of Cells at Work, and a bit of gaming (I tried The Legend of Zelda but now preferred simpler puzzle games or digital versions of Rummikub).",

        "question_ch": "使用屏幕或观看节目如何影响你在睡前或白天的情绪？",
        "answer_en": "I’ve discovered that when I spend too long in front of screens—whether it’s watching a cartoon, a nature documentary or scrolling on a tablet—my thoughts don’t settle easily as bedtime approaches and I feel restless instead of calm. My heart seems to beat a little faster, as if I’m still chasing dragons or running from dinosaurs, and my mind keeps replaying bright images so I lie awake staring at the ceiling. During the day, too much screen time makes me squint and gives me headaches, and I find it harder to concentrate on my nature notebook or my math puzzles. After an hour or so with a show, I notice I’m less inclined to play outside or read real books; I feel sluggish, almost as if my energy has been absorbed by the glowing box. That’s why I try to stop screens at least an hour before bed and balance my day with kite-flying, sketching beetles and reading about stars—then I sleep soundly and wake up eager to explore.",
        "answer_ch": "我发现，当我在屏幕前待太久时，无论是看卡通、自然纪录片还是在平板上滑动，临近睡觉时我的思绪都不容易平静下来，我感到不安而不是放松。我的心跳似乎加快了，仿佛我还在追逐龙或者逃离恐龙，我的大脑不断重放鲜艳的画面，以至于我躺在床上望着天花板难以入眠。白天，过多的屏幕时间让我眯起眼，还会导致头痛，我发现自己更难集中注意力在自然笔记本或数学难题上。看节目一个小时左右后，我注意到自己不太想出去玩或阅读真正的书籍；我感到无精打采，几乎感觉我的能量被那发光的盒子吸收了。这就是为什么我尽量在睡前至少一个小时停止使用屏幕，并用放风筝、画甲虫和阅读星星的书来平衡我的一天——这样我就能安稳地睡觉，醒来时渴望探索。"

On Saturdays and Sundays I either turn the alarm off completely and let myself wake up naturally—usually around 8 a.m. or later—or I set it for about 8 :30 when we need to be up early for a family outing or to visit Grandma and Grandpa. This way weekends feel much more relaxed than the strict 7 a.m. start on school days.",

I ran my hand over the fabric to test its softness and weight, imagining walking to school or hiking with binoculars. Once I deemed the item comfortable I examined its color, choosing blues or greens that matched my mood or the season—blue for clear skies, green for days in the park. Style came last: I checked pockets for my notebook, whether a hood might keep me warm against the wind, and how the overall design reflected my personality—functional yet not dull. By the time I had comfort, color, and style in order, I felt confident I had chosen the right outfit for the day.",

I manage this almost every school day, so five times a week. It only takes me five minutes, but I find it really helps wake me up before making breakfast and walking to school. On weekend mornings I sometimes swap the jumping jacks for a short jog with Dad in Hampstead Heath or a few extra stretches in the garden. I don’t do it as often in holidays because I’m keen to build kites or paint, but I do try to stretch at least every other morning so I feel ready for the day.",

I rushed through my wash and dressing while Dad quickly made my breakfast and handed it to me at the door so I wouldn’t skip it entirely, then I grabbed my packed bag and sprinted downstairs. I decided I could safely skip optional chores like folding my laundry or tidying my room, tasks I’d catch up on later, but I never skipped brushing my teeth or gathering my school essentials.

Then I emptied my pencil case onto my desk: I sharpened each pencil, tested every pen, and lined up my erasers, rulers, and compass neatly in my little drawer. If I hadn’t done it at once, stray papers and half-used pens would end up scattered across the room, and I’d feel restless until everything was in its place.

        "answer_en": "I usually waited until the table was cleared, then asked if I could help sort the dishes—I’d lift the lids of the casserole or stir what was left of the soup to cool it slightly, then spoon portions into plastic containers, snapping the lids tight and writing the date with a washable marker, because Mum always likes us to know how long something’s been in the fridge; if it was something she thought I’d like for school lunch—like curry or macaroni cheese—I’d set that container on the worktop so she could slip it straight into my lunchbox in the morning, but if it was more than I could eat in two days I’d pop it into the freezer, saying to myself “Don’t waste food,” because I remembered how Grandpa once told me we should treat food like treasure, then I’d wipe down the counter, put the containers in the fridge door where they were easy to find, and feel satisfied that I’d both helped Mom and made Tuesday’s lunch a little easier.",

        "answer_en": "I always showered in the evening, usually around seven-thirty after dinner, because mornings were too rushed for a proper wash; I’d step into the warm spray, wet my hair and body, then squeeze a small dollop of mild shampoo—often the organic one Mum bought at the market—into my palm, work it into a lather, and scrub my scalp for about a minute before rinsing thoroughly; next I’d lather up a bar of lavender-scented soap on a loofah, wash from neck to toes, paying extra attention to my elbows and underarms, rinse off in another minute or so, then turn off the water, towel-dry myself, brush my teeth and floss while my hair dampened, apply a dab of vegetable-based moisturizer to my face, and finally slip into soft cotton pyjamas—altogether the ritual took me about ten to fifteen minutes, and it always left me feeling calm, refreshed, and ready for a good night’s sleep.",

Next I take a length of dental floss and gently work it up and down between each pair of teeth, paying special attention to where plaque tends to build up—usually my molars.

I’ve found that stories like The Wind in the Willows, where animals speak in quiet meadows, and episodes of The Magic School Bus, where science feels like magic behind every page, soothe my mind. When I draw, I sketch soaring birds, curling ferns, or a single silver leaf illuminated by moonlight—the act of tracing each line with a soft pencil calms my breath.

Once I’m up, I swap my uniform for something comfortable, wander into the kitchen to help Dad or even attempt breakfast myself (often whole‐wheat toast with marmalade), then feed Colonel Rock and top up the bird feeders before I change out of pyjamas. There’s no mad rush to pack a schoolbag or do morning chores on a tight schedule so I take time to sketch in my notebook or read a few pages of Britannica. If it’s a Saturday when Mum’s working I’ll help Dad wake Lucien and we all bundle into the car for breakfast at Grandma’s house; if it’s a holiday Monday we might stretch out in the garden with binoculars, birdwatching before we go fortify ourselves with brunch.

I hung collared shirts and trousers on wooden hangers in my wardrobe, buttoning the shirts so they kept their shape, and sorted my sports shorts and PE kit into a lower drawer. I found folding on my bed helped me see the whole pile grow, and sorting by colour meant I could always find my favourite dark-blue jumper in a second. Once everything was in its place, I straightened my desk and fluffed my pillows, pleased to see my room look tidy before I went off to help Dad with dinner.",

If I’m really prone to forget I’ll ask Mum or Dad for a gentle reminder or set a timer on their phone—when the alarm rings it’s my signal to start.

I also found myself rushing through my math practice so I wouldn’t miss the first fifteen minutes. After two weeks I realized I needed a plan: I began setting out my insect-club gear on the table each morning and blocking off a special “homework hour” right after school. I learned to finish my PSHE reading in the car, so by the time I reached the door of the science lab I was ready to dive straight into identifying ladybirds and hoverflies. My parents helped by setting a quiet timer at home, and I discovered that by moving art time to right after dinner I could always leave fully prepared for entomology adventures.

The toast is special because I love experimenting with different breads, toasting levels, and marmalades—Bonne Maman’s tangy sweetness reminds me of Paddington’s marmalade and the delight of my earliest kitchen “alchemy.” The lamb soup, taught to me by Jessica, is like a warm hug on cold days: its rich broth and soft, tear-apart flatbread connect me to new cultures and feel like an ongoing family adventure.

Luthien quarrelled over whose turn it was to choose the music—jazz for Mom, Doctor Who theme for Dad—then giggled when Grandpa George’s voice rang out from my phone, answering our questions about mushrooms for my science experiment. We took turns describing our days: I’d recount my latest butterfly sightings or the new sketch I’d made at Owen’s studio; Dad spoke of his classroom’s tangled history debate; Mom told us about a tricky diagnosis that made her grateful for our home; Luthien chattered about princess dolls and playground races.

In the morning I was tired, my mind still half in that strange place where I’d met Orla in a giant library or floated beside an alien named Hassor.

A year later my mum added vitamin D drops through the dark London winters, and I began a weekly spoonful of cod-liver oil for healthy bones and a sharper mind during long nature hikes. Whenever I felt the first tickle of a cold, I popped a chewable vitamin C tablet, and almost every time the sore throat vanished by morning. Now, at eight, I noticed I caught far fewer sniffles, recovered quicker after colds, and felt steadier energy in the afternoons—no more dragging feet at school or yawning through science experiments. My head felt clearer, my legs stronger on Hampstead Heath, and even the occasional nosebleed in dry weather became almost a thing of the past.",

If my throat was sore I switched to a mug of organic ginger-lemon-honey tea, which cut through the sniffles and warmed me right down to my toes.

        "answer_en": "I’ve learned to tell the difference by paying close attention to how my body feels and by testing simple solutions: true hunger comes with a hollow, rumbling sensation low in my stomach, a drop in energy, even a mild headache, and almost any food—savory or plain—sounds appealing. Thirst, by contrast, brings a dry mouth and scratchy throat, and a large glass of water (or a few soda crackers) quickly makes those sensations go away. Boredom “hunger” feels more like a nagging thought—“I should snack”—but if I pick up a book, sketch in my notebook or drink water and then wait ten minutes, the urge often disappears entirely. So my rule is: first drink water, wait a short while, and if the stomach still feels empty afterward, I know it’s genuine hunger; if not, it was probably just thirst or boredom.",
        "answer_ch": "我学会了通过密切关注我的身体感受和测试简单的解决方案来区分饥饿和其他感受：真正的饥饿伴随着一种低沉的、咕噜咕噜的感觉，能量下降，甚至出现轻微的头痛，几乎任何食物——咸的或简单的——都显得诱人。而相反，口渴则带来干燥的嘴巴和刺痛的喉咙，一大杯水（或者几块苏打饼干）可以迅速消除这些感觉。无聊的“饥饿”更像是一个恼人的念头——“我应该吃点零食”——但如果我拿起一本书，在笔记本上画画或喝水，然后等待十分钟，这种冲动往往会完全消失。因此，我的原则是：首先喝水，等一会儿，如果肚子还是感觉空，那我就知道是真正的饥饿；如果没有，那可能只是口渴或无聊。"

My favourite is the “child’s pose,” which means kneeling on my mat, sitting back on my heels and stretching my arms forward until my forehead rests on the floor—it feels like the world slows down around me and all the tension drifts away. I also like a gentle “cat-cow” sequence: on all fours I arch my back upward like an angry cat, then drop my belly down like a relaxed cow—this really wakes up my spine. Another one I find comforting is a seated forward fold: I sit with legs straight out, inhale to lengthen my back, and as I exhale I bend forward to reach my toes, keeping my knees soft; it releases my hamstrings and quiets my mind. Sometimes I finish with a wall-supported shoulder stretch—standing with my arm bent at ninety degrees against a wall and gently turning away—because I spend a lot of time drawing and typing and my shoulders get tight. After these, even if I only did them for five minutes, I always feel calmer, more awake, and ready to tackle whatever experiment or sketch is next.",

I eat carrots almost as often—either peeled and raw or grated into salads—because I like how their natural sugars release a gentle sweetness as I chew, and they’re sturdy enough to carry in my backpack without getting squashed. Berries—especially blueberries and raspberries—feel like treats by comparison; I only get them on weekend nature hikes or in smoothies after science experiments, but I adore how their tiny juice pockets burst with flavor and color, reminding me of stained-glass windows in a butterfly’s wings.

She explained that fruit acids could weaken my enamel and showed me on a small model how to brush in tiny circles along the gum line and how floss should slide between my teeth rather than snap hard. After polishing, she took a small X‐ray and pointed out that my wisdom teeth hadn’t begun growing yet but might need monitoring when I’m older. A few months before that I’d visited my mother’s clinic for a routine GP checkup where the doctor measured my height and weight, listened to my heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and asked me to blow into a small tube to measure my breathing capacity—she said my lungs were slightly stronger than average for my age, probably because of our weekend hikes. She also taught me how vitamin D from sunshine helps my bones absorb calcium more effectively.

If the pain doesn’t ease in fifteen or twenty minutes, I let Mum know and she might give me a mild antacid or paracetamol, but only after we’ve ruled out that I’ve eaten something spoiled or too heavy. I avoid screen time or studying right away so my body can focus on settling my stomach, and once I feel a bit better I write a quick note in my health diary about what I ate and how I felt, so I can spot any patterns and avoid the same mistake next time.",

At the same time there’s a sudden jolt of energy: my heart beats a bit faster and my mind feels jumpy and excited, like I’ve downed an espresso without meaning to. I grow restless, wanting to run or shout or build something wild out of LEGO, but after an hour that wired feeling crashes into a heavy tiredness—my head feels fuzzy and my limbs sluggish, as if all the sugar has pulled the power right out of me. I’ve learned from my mom that eating balanced snacks—protein or whole‐grain toast with marmalade—helps avoid that roller-coaster of sugar rush and sugar slump, so now I try to limit candy to a small treat and save my real energy for exploring nature or experimenting in the kitchen.",

I usually drank a small glass of it two or three times a week, most often on weekend mornings when I helped Dad make pancakes or on Sundays at Grandma’s house. During the school week I rarely had juice—a glass of water or iced milk felt more practical before rushing to school—but I savoured apple juice whenever I could, sometimes even experimenting with my own juicer to coax the same flavour from garden apples.",

        "answer_ch": "我通常通过结合几种方法来保护自己免受晒伤，而不是仅仅依赖一种方法：在任何长时间的户外活动之前，我会提前大约二十分钟向所有暴露的皮肤涂抹至少SPF 50的广谱有机防晒霜，并确保每两小时或游泳后重新涂抹；我穿着轻便、长袖且透气的衬衫，并戴上宽边帽子以遮挡脸部和颈部；每当太阳在中午最高时，我会携带一把小巧的防紫外线伞，或在橡树的树荫下搭建；在外出前，我还会在天气应用上查看紫外线指数，计划在清晨或下午晚些时候进行徒步旅行，那时阳光的强度较低——所有这些预防措施加在一起使我避免了新晒伤的刺痛，能够专注于观察自然，而不是忍受疼痛的发红。"

I think people weigh themselves and measure their height because it’s an easy way to judge health and growth: parents use it to see if children are getting enough nutrition, doctors rely on it to spot concerns like under- or overweight, and athletes track it to optimise performance. Beyond that, many adults monitor these numbers for dieting or fitness goals, while others simply want reassurance that they’re growing (or ageing) as expected. Unfortunately, it can also become a measure of self-worth when social pressures about body image take over, but at its best, it’s just a simple health check.",

Next, I often retreated indoors to our shaded living room, where the curtains were drawn and a fan circulated the air—staying out of direct sunlight kept me from getting dizzy or sunburned. But after an hour of reading or sketching with my 24-color pencils, I’d grow restless and bundle up my notebook in a waterproof bag, then sprint outside to join my sister under the garden sprinklers; nothing felt more freeing than running through the fine spray of water, feeling droplets vanish against my skin and listening to the laughter echo off the brick walls. Once I was soaked, I’d race back indoors, peel off my damp clothes, and stand by the open window so the breeze could dry me off while I sipped another glass of water. In this way I found a balance: drinking to stay hydrated, resting inside to recover, and moving outside in the sprinklers for pure, cooler-than-air fun.",

For deeper dirt—especially after a soggy hike—I fill a basin with cool water, a little gentle detergent, and use an old toothbrush to clean the seams and soles; I never soak leather parts for more than a minute or two.

I dab it dry with a clean handkerchief, apply a small drop of antiseptic cream using a cotton pad, and then cover it with a suitable-sized adhesive bandage so it stays protected as I go about my day. If the scrape is deeper than I think I can handle safely, or if the bleeding doesn’t slow after a minute or two of firm pressure, I stop what I’m doing, call for my mum or dad, and let them check it—better to ask for help than risk an infection. I always make sure to change the bandage once a day and watch the spot carefully; if it becomes red, warm, or sore in a new way, I ask my mum to take a look right away.",

Once my breathing steadies I open my eyes, look around to name five things I can see—maybe a leaf on a branch, a cloud drifting, a pebble at my feet—and remind myself that I’m safe in the present.

With each careful line, I felt my shoulders loosen a little: tracing his whiskers and his gentle eyes became a way of breathing out my sorrow.

Sometimes I’d switch on my mother’s jazz records, letting the soft trumpet and walking bass soothe my thoughts while I lay on the carpet and traced imaginary constellations with my finger. Other times I escaped to Hampstead Heath, binoculars slung over my shoulder, and lost myself in watching birds or cloud shapes for half an hour, timing each breath to the gentle rise and fall of tree branches in the breeze. If I couldn’t step outside, I’d fling open my sketchbook pages and draw wild, looping lines until the frustration drained away. Even folding and refolding my handkerchief—its cotton edge pressed into my palm—reminded me to breathe more slowly.

If I still feel afraid I count slowly from one to one hundred in my head or think of every bird I’ve ever spotted to remind myself the world is full of living creatures, not scary ghosts; sometimes I whisper out loud “I’m safe, I’m safe,” and if needed I tiptoe down and ask Mum to tuck me in again, because it’s brave to admit you need help, and it always makes me feel calmer.",

To let it out safely I sometimes slip away to the garden and sprint until my legs ache, or I fling paint onto a canvas in Uncle Owen’s studio, watching the colors burst like lightning. Other times I curl up with a pillow and roar into it, tearing up old notebooks or scrunching paper into balls, then I sit quietly with my handkerchief, breathe deeply and count to ten, and finally I tell Mom what happened so the fire inside can cool and I can think clearly again.",

I had been trying so hard to keep up, believing that if I only ran faster I would be as impressive as her. My stomach twisted every time she smiled at my slow pace. The jealousy came from a worry that if I could not excel at this sport my parents and friends might think less of me. I held the anger quietly in my chest for days until I finally told my dad how upset I felt. He listened carefully, admitted he had been pushing me into tennis even though I disliked it, and promised to let me choose my own activities. Talking to him lifted a weight from my shoulders. Then I reminded myself of the many things I do well—science experiments, drawing, hiking—and began celebrating those successes instead of resenting others. Over time the jealousy faded and I realized I could be happy for Rosa’s victories and still be proud of my own achievements.",

She turned off the stove, guided me to sit at the table, and listened as I explained what I feared—getting all my words mixed up or seeing my classmates laugh. Then she reached across the table and said, “I know it feels huge right now, but this feeling will pass, and you know more than you think you do.” She reminded me of all the small speeches I’d given at home, the times I’d read aloud without stumbling, and how she’d been proud of me then. She told me to practice once more, imagining the faces in the audience were just friendly trees in the park, and that no matter what happened, she and Dad would still hug me afterward.

I imagine every question flying at me before I’ve had time to summon my thoughts. I start planning possible answers, pacing between desk and board in my head, but none of it sticks. My palms get sweaty, my heart pounds, and I struggle to remember even the simplest formulas or facts I’ve practiced a hundred times. It feels like standing at the edge of a cliff without warning. Over time I’ve learned that taking a deep breath, closing my eyes for a moment, and recalling one familiar fact—like the steps of the scientific method—can steady me.

I had stormed in there furious after a big fight at school, my chest burning as if I might explode, and Owen quietly showed me a corner he’d set aside for me. He pointed to row after row of paint jars, told me I could use anything for my own creation, and then left me to it. I stood there, feeling the heat of anger and how much I wanted to smash something, and suddenly I grabbed several jars—brilliant reds, deep blues, zesty yellows—took a blank canvas taller than me, and flung the paint with all my strength. For what felt like an eternity I hurled colors in every direction until my arms ached and my heart finally settled. When I caught my breath and looked at the canvas, I was stunned: it wasn’t a painting of anything I’d ever seen—it was pure energy, every furious, joyful, confused feeling I’d had, all transformed into bright, powerful splashes. Owen came back quietly, put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Isaac, you are a true artist now,” and I remember beaming so wide I thought my face would crack. Even now, every time I think of that moment—of paint flying through the air, of that wild, wonderful colorscape, and of Owen’s quiet pride—I can’t help but smile.",

From that instant I was driven to hunt for more fossils: I spent every spare hour combing the shingle, sketching each find in a little notebook, measuring its size and sketching the patterns, then mapping exactly where I found it. By the end of the holiday I had collected half a dozen specimens and written my own “beach log,” and back home I turned my bedroom into a miniature museum, carefully labeling each piece.

Even in Owen’s studio, after I’d flung paint everywhere, the look on his face when a blob landed on my cheek sent us both into giggles. Sharing those laughs felt like handing out fireworks—we’d point, we’d mimic each other’s faces, and soon the whole room erupted.

The air smelled of damp seaweed and fresh rain, each footstep stirring silver droplets from the fine sand. Beneath the pastel horizon seagulls and curlews called softly as the first rays gilded the arch, turning it from shadow to gold. I watched the tide slip in and out like a slow heartbeat, thought how small I was in the sweep of earth and time. There was no sound but the sea and my calm breath.

After the squirrel drank and hopped back into a nearby tree, Gerald gasped, “Isaac, you’re an animal expert!” We walked home together, chatting non-stop about wildlife, discovered we lived only ten minutes apart and shared more stories than either of us expected.

Sometimes we take our kites up to Parliament Hill, testing new designs and competing to see whose stays aloft longest. On rainy days we gather at Owen’s studio or Gerald’s kitchen to invent crazy science projects—one week it’s homemade soap scented with coffee grounds, the next it’s experimenting with marmalade recipes or citrus jam for tea. We also play board games—Rummikub or Snakes & Ladders usually—shouting when someone tumbles down a snake, and whenever a new museum exhibition opens (dinosaur fossils or ancient Egyptian art) we pile into Dad’s car for an afternoon visit, exchanging excited whispers in the galleries.

For example, Gerald became part of my inner circle the moment we rescued that little squirrel together—his kindness and willingness to follow my lead showed me he cared about more than just games.  Leslie joined when he surprised me by teaching me new kite-flying tricks and then chiming in with imaginative ideas: his enthusiasm and openness to learn made him a natural teammate.  I welcome anyone who listens without judging—like Maeve, who stood up when others laughed at someone in kindergarten—and I steer clear of kids who mock or bully others, such as Kirk, because I want our group to feel safe for everyone.  In playtime or on a school project, I choose friends who share my interests—science experiments, art creations, hiking plans—and who make me feel like I can be myself.  If someone shows curiosity, kindness and a readiness to explore alongside me, they’re “in.”",

By the time I’d grabbed my racket, everyone had paired off and left me standing by the fence. I tried to step onto the court, but they carried on—hitting balls, calling out to each other, not even glancing my way. My chest felt tight and hot, and I suddenly didn’t care about tennis at all. I sat on a bench, tracing the court lines with my finger while my lessons went on without me. When Dad noticed I hadn’t joined in and came to find me, he asked if I wanted to quit. I nodded, too embarrassed to explain. Later he told me he’d misunderstood my silence, and that he should have asked how I felt before signing me up.

Then we brainstorm a solution that works for both of us, whether it’s taking turns in a game, changing our plan for a science experiment, or simply agreeing to disagree and try again later.

After that I offered to help fix what I had done wrong—if I’d broken something I offered to repair or replace it, if I’d forgotten a promise I worked out a plan to keep it next time—and sometimes I drew a small picture or wrote a note to remind them that I cared. If they still needed space I gave it to them, letting them know I’d be there when they were ready to talk.

Even when she spends weeks in icy water studying plankton or dives in rough seas, she never complains, she just laughs and says, “The world is full of surprises.” Watching her turn complicated ideas about evolution and marine ecosystems into stories I can understand made me see that science isn’t just tests and textbooks but an adventure where you follow clues, learn from mistakes, and keep searching when others give up.

Being able to forgive each other’s slip-ups, to encourage each other’s dreams and to respect our differences—whether in taste in music or confidence on the tennis court—creates a feeling of safety, as if you know someone will stand by you no matter what.

I’ve seen the same with my sister Lucien—when she accidentally knocked over my bug tank she didn’t just cry “sorry” once but carefully helped me clean up every drop of soil and checked each beetle before she ran off to school. And when Dad apologized to Mum for pushing her too hard with my tennis lessons, he didn’t just promise to stop, he let go of my racket and said “we’ll only do what you like,” and I felt the tension leave the room.

Watching him adjust the string, shift his weight, and coax the kite into gentle loops, I felt a surge of inspiration: could I build and fly my own kite, using different shapes to see how they danced? That very weekend I rummaged through old newspapers and bamboo sticks, sketched dozens of kite designs in my notebook, and spent hours testing them in the park—even though most tumbled earthward.

A good sense of humor brightens every day; when Gerald and I tumbled laughing on the field after our practice match I felt our bond grow stronger with every giggle. I also admire curiosity—like when Leslie taught me to fly his Chinese swallow kite and explained its history I saw how his eagerness turned learning into adventure.

Sometimes we had to peel things apart and start again, and a few times I thought the whole model would collapse, but neither Gerald’s blisters nor Chen Jia’s frustration ever stopped us. Piece by piece, layer by layer, the carrier grew under our hands. Two weeks later, we stood back and admired that four-foot-long ship, complete with miniature fighter jets and lifeboats.

I was so relieved and grateful that that evening I invited Gerald over for homemade marmalade on toast—his favorite—and even painted him a little squirrel portrait, handing it to him with a shy “Thank you for being my hero today,” which made him laugh and say he’d always be there when I needed him.",

        "answer_en": "I usually start by stopping to think: I first make sure I really understand the problem, then break it into smaller pieces in my head or on paper—like writing down what I know, what I need to find out, and any rules or steps I’ve learned that might apply. Once I have that plan, I often sketch a quick diagram or jot down a sequence of steps, then try each one carefully, seeing what happens. If that doesn’t work, I adjust a little—maybe change one part of the plan or try a different tool—until something clicks. Sometimes, when I’m eager or curious, I’ll simply dive in and experiment—trying different materials, rearranging the parts, tweaking my approach—and learn from each “failure” until I find a solution. So it’s a mix: I prefer a step-by-step plan to guide me, but I’m not afraid to test ideas quickly and learn by doing.",
        "answer_ch": "我通常开始时会停下来思考：我首先确保我真正理解了问题，然后在脑海中或纸上将其分解成更小的部分——比如写下我所知道的、我需要找到的，以及我学到的任何可能适用的规则或步骤。一旦我有了这个计划，我通常会快速画一个草图或写下一系列步骤，然后仔细尝试每一个，看看会发生什么。如果那不奏效，我会稍微调整一下——也许更改计划的某个部分或尝试不同的工具——直到找出解决方案。有时，当我充满热情或好奇心时，我会直接跳进去实验——尝试不同的材料、重新排列部分、调整我的方法——并从每一次“失败”中学习，直到找到解决方案。所以这是一种混合：我更喜欢一个逐步的计划来引导我，但我不怕快速测试想法并通过实践学习。"

When I opened the box I found dozens of wooden panels, tiny screws, metal brackets and one daunting instruction sheet. My first move was to empty everything onto the living-room floor and spread out the instruction sheet right beside it. I carefully matched each numbered board to its picture—comparing the shape, the predrilled holes, the edge trim—until all the pieces were neatly arranged in piles. Only then did I pick up the first panel and screw it into its partner, step by step, knowing exactly which parts went together. Lining up the boards before I began turned a confusing jigsaw of wood into a manageable project—and by the end of the afternoon, I’d built a sturdy new bookshelf all by myself.",

If that still doesn’t work, I consult a book or my notebook, since reading a clear explanation often helps me see a new path. When I’m truly baffled, I’ll ask for help—usually Dad, Uncle Irvin or Mom—because they each have different strengths: Dad breaks things into simple steps, Irvin suggests creative solutions, and Mom often knows exactly which question to ask me to reframe the problem. Sometimes I also take a short break—watching clouds on the Heath or listening to the hum of the city—and let my mind wander until a new idea strikes.

If I’m sharing Art supplies with Maeve I’ll ask her if she’s used more crayons than I have and let her pick the next color. When we take turns at kite flying I’ll count aloud—one, two, three—and let everyone have the same number of turns before someone goes again. If Gerald has had more pieces of chocolate cake, I make sure I have fewer or offer to give him first pick next time.

I’d do this because every toy has an owner who cares about it, and returning it can make someone’s day. Holding onto it or hiding it until someone asks shows empathy and responsibility; in science we always return things to their proper place so experiments work, and in life returning a lost toy is much the same principle of fairness and respect.

        "answer_en": "To me, being honest means speaking only what I believe to be true, even when it’s hard, and admitting when I don’t know or when I’ve made a mistake; it’s more than just not lying—it’s aligning my words with my thoughts and my actions with my values. I know I’m telling the truth when I can look back at what I said and see that it matches what I observed or felt, when I have no secret reasons or hidden fears guiding my words, and when my conscience feels calm rather than uneasy. Often I’ve tested my honesty by checking facts (like when I carefully counted beetles in the park) or by asking myself whether I’m saying something to help myself or to help others. If my heart feels clear and I’m willing to accept the consequences of my words—good or bad—that’s the moment I realize I’ve been honest.",
        "answer_ch": "对我来说，诚实意味着只说我认为真实的东西，即使这很困难，并且承认我不知道或者我犯了错误。这不仅仅是不说谎，更是让我的言语与我的思想相一致，让我的行为与我的价值观相符合。当我能回顾我所说的话并看到它与我观察到的或感受到的一致时，当我的话没有秘密的动机或隐藏的恐惧指引时，并且当我的良心感到平静而非不安时，我知道我在说真话。我常常通过核实事实（比如我仔细地计算公园里的甲虫）或问自己是否在说些帮助自己还是帮助他人的事情来测试我的诚实。如果我内心感到清晰，并且愿意接受我言辞的后果——无论是好是坏——那就是我意识到我诚实的时刻。"

I break big tasks into smaller steps and tackle the hardest part while I’m still alert, then save the quick jobs as little rewards for later.

Every morning I’d tiptoe to the vivarium, check the temperature gauge, note the date on my calendar and shine my torch on the smooth whitish eggs, looking for the tiniest crack.  As each day passed I learnt to recognise even the faintest pinprick of a pip—tiny flecks of shell—or the faint movement of one egg when I tapped gently.  When I finally saw one egg split and a tiny, damp gecko emerge, I knew my waiting was over: the incubation period had told me exactly when my turn to hold those babies had come, and all those mornings of careful watching gave way to the happiest moment of discovery.",

If I see crossed arms, shifting weight or quick glances away, it might hint they’re uneasy. Second, I listen to their words and voice: truthful people answer quickly, with consistent details and without contradicting themselves. If their story changes each time or they hesitate and add too many excuses, I get suspicious. Finally, I compare what they say to what I already know—facts I remember or details I can check. For example, if a friend tells me they were at the Natural History Museum last Friday but I know they had football practice, then I ask a few questions to clear up the mismatch. Combining these clues—steady eyes and calm posture, clear and consistent speech, and agreement with known facts—helps me decide how much I trust what they’re telling me.",

But simply saying sorry isn’t enough, so I immediately ask how I can set things right—whether that means redoing a drawing I messed up or helping to clean up a spilled puzzle. If it’s something I can fix myself, like offering to make a new sandwich when I burned one, I do that straight away. Sometimes, though, the best fix isn’t obvious, and I’ll pause for a moment to think or ask a grown-up for advice—once I tried to apologize to Peter, our rabbit, after his cage was accidentally left open and I spent an hour drawing him a replacement sign with his name on it so he’d feel welcome when I found him again. Waiting until someone notices first can make things worse, so I’ve learned that owning up quickly, apologizing honestly and then working on a solution is the fairest and kindest way to make amends.",

Sometimes, if it’s a truly glorious day and the garden looks too inviting, I’ll mix things up: do half an hour of work, then twenty minutes of play, and repeat. That way I earn each outdoor break and stay motivated for my homework. I keep an eye on the clock or set a timer so I don’t lose track of time.

One day when Sophie and I shared Bonne Maman marmalade, I carefully spread exactly the same thickness on two slices of toast and we compared to make sure they looked identical before we ate.  That reminded me that what feels fair depends on what you’re sharing: food needs equal pieces, play needs equal turns, and screens or special equipment need equal time.",

These instructions are simple operations (add these two numbers, compare this value, jump to address X if it’s zero, and so on), each taking just a few billionths of a second.  \n\nOn top of that you write programs in “big chunks” for your own convenience—functions, classes, libraries and modules in Python, Java or C++, for example. Those get translated by a compiler or interpreter into the low-level instructions the hardware understands. So when you say “do my_app.process_input(),” behind the scenes millions of tiny steps are being carried out.  \n\nIn short: your code’s big-picture structure gives computers an overall plan, but the chip itself must follow each step in order—fetch, decode and execute—just like a very fast, very precise cook following a detailed recipe.",

If someone’s name or initials weren’t on it I’d make a tiny scribble on scrap paper and compare it with the handwriting of the kids at my table. Next I’d quietly ask around, “Is anyone missing a blue striped pencil?”—starting with the few classmates who like exactly that kind of pencil. If nobody claimed it, I’d dust the pencil with a bit of chalk on my handkerchief and hold it under my magnifier to look for fingerprints—sometimes the smudges left by oily grips are surprisingly telltale. Failing that, I’d leave it on the teacher’s desk with a little note saying where I found it and my name, because someone will read that and say, “That’s exactly where I lost mine!” In the end it’s a mix of observation, handwriting clues, gentle questions, and a touch of science that always leads back to the right owner.",

Once at school a squirrel lay motionless in the grass because it was too frightened to move. I knew we weren’t supposed to handle wild animals, but I wrapped it in my handkerchief, gave it water and peanuts, and then fetched help. I broke the rule, yes, but saving that creature felt right. Later I explained to the teacher why I did it. I believe rules earn respect when they serve a higher purpose—if a rule stands between me and helping, I help first and explain afterward; if the rule genuinely keeps everyone safe, I follow it first. That way I balance respect for rules with respect for those who need help.",

Sometimes that means a compromise—each friend gives a little—or taking turns, or finding a new idea they both like.

After that I get dressed and then go downstairs to eat breakfast. By assigning each action a position—first, second, third, fourth—I turn the routine into a clear list in my head. If I ever forget whether I brushed my teeth before or after getting dressed, I replay the list: waking up came before brushing, and brushing came before clothing. Sometimes I draw tiny icons on a piece of paper—an alarm clock, a bed, a toothbrush—to help me see the order at a glance. Thinking about cause and effect also helps: because I made the bed first, my room felt tidier before I brushed my teeth, and because I brushed my teeth third, my breath was fresh before breakfast. When I slip a step out of order, I can feel something’s off—like I forgot to put on socks before tying my shoes—so I know exactly where I went wrong.

If someone asks me to stay silent but what I know could protect my sister or a friend, I must speak up. And when a parent, teacher or another responsible adult asks about a secret for safety or understanding, it’s right to answer honestly.

If an event refers back to something “earlier” or “in the past,” I move it before on my timeline. When chapters or scenes jump around, I reread the text to spot dates or phrases indicating flashbacks. Color-coding helps me too—using one color for events in one day and another color for events in another day.

Seeing the stickers add up keeps me motivated because I can concentrate on one small job instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire room, and when every item has a sticker, the big task is complete and I feel like I’ve solved a grand puzzle.",

If someone is hungrier, they can take two smaller slices or agree that next time they share more—this way everyone gets the same total pizza and no one feels short-changed.

For video games that need buttons and local play I grab my Nintendo Switch because its controls feel right and I can wander my castle or build machines without lag. When I’m doing homework—writing essays, typing up science notes or looking up facts in online encyclopedias—I use Dad’s laptop since the keyboard and browser help me work quickly and neatly. If I’m watching nature documentaries or Doctor Who with Dad and Luthien I switch to the big TV so everyone can see the details on a large screen. But for quick videos, language apps or drawing diagrams I choose my iPad because I can pause and rewind with one finger, jot notes directly on the screen and carry it anywhere without dragging a heavy computer. I also think about battery life and noise—if I’m travelling to grandparents or camping I’ll use the iPad or even my phone instead of the laptop. And when I’m outside exploring at Hampstead Heath or Richmond Park I leave all devices behind and rely on binoculars, a magnifier and my notebook.

When I want something new, I’ll ask Gerald or Leslie what they’re watching, then I’ll look it up on the iPad or the TV’s menu. Other times I poke around the App Store, typing words like “science,” “animals,” or “cartoons,” and see what pops up—sometimes I’ll download a free trial of a game just to test it. My dad and mom also suggest things: Dad steers me toward sci-fi series like Doctor Who, and Mum often finds nature documentaries online and shares them at dinner. Sophie, my older neighbor, recommended a puzzle-making app that helps me plan my insect surveys. I’ve even discovered shows and videos by browsing the library’s DVD shelf or watching trailers on YouTube—if something catches my eye, I’ll remember the name and ask Mum to play it later. And whenever I’m at Irvin’s studio or Audrey’s garden, I’ll spot a program on their screens and ask about it.

I was allowed to use my tablet for homework or educational videos right after school, but only until six o’clock, because dinner preparation and family time came first. After dinner I could watch or play for half an hour—no longer—and only in the living room where Mum or Dad could see. At seven-thirty my screen time was over and the devices went back to their charging station; sometimes Sophie, our neighbor, and I could extend it to watch a nature documentary on Fridays, but only if all chores and reading were done. In the bedroom there were no screens after nine, and lights out was always by ten, so my brain wouldn’t stay buzzing when I tried to fall asleep. If I needed to look something up for my insect projects or check a translation for Chinese homework, I asked for a minute’s permission—they’d unlock the content they approved and then lock it again when I’d finished. Whenever I queued up videos of ancient pyramids or how to feed my geckos, my parents reminded me that real discoveries often came from binoculars and field notebooks rather than YouTube, so I learned to balance a walk in the park with only a quick online search at home.",

It would record the exact time and GPS location of every sighting in your personal journal so you could track migrations, seasonal changes and even create your own “butterfly explosion” map for Hampstead Heath or Kew Gardens. The app would also challenge you with weekly missions—find three different pollinators this week, or spot a robin before sunrise—encouraging you to get outside. You could sketch your finds directly in the app or attach a photo, then share your discoveries safely with friends and classmates who could comment with tips or their own sightings. Best of all, it would include a “Junior Naturalist” badge system so that every new species you log earns you points toward real paper patches you can sew onto your jacket—just like belonging to a secret society of explorers.

When I’m stuck on a math problem, it walks me through each step with hints instead of just giving the answer, so I understand why things work. I’ve used it to review multiplication tables, learn about fractions and even watch mini-lessons on simple physics concepts like gravity and forces. It also has reading activities that help me build new vocabulary and comprehension skills, and keeps track of my progress so I know what to practice next. Because I can learn at my own pace and earn stars for each completed lesson, it makes me feel confident and motivated to tackle the next challenge.",

After a few weeks, my parents even emailed his mother to say hello, and she wrote back giving me a friendly hello and saying Marcus really loved learning about British butterflies.

Each time you catch a bug it shows a fun fact I typed in—like how rainbow stag beetles browse under logs—and plays a little cheering sound. I spent evenings sketching the insect pictures, figuring out the “forever” loops for movement and the random timers, and fine-tuning the scoring so it’s challenging without being impossible.

It made me laugh because the cat’s expression is so calm and blank in the middle of all that drama, like it’s thinking, “Why are you so upset at me for sitting here?” It reminds me of my sister Lucy, who sometimes yells at me when I take her crayons, and I just stare back quietly, which always makes her more annoyed. The sudden contrast between extreme anger and total indifference is so silly that I burst out giggling every time I see it.",
        "answer_ch": "我见过的最搞笑的 meme 是“女人对着猫尖叫”那张——一边是一个愤怒的女人在大声喊叫，另一边是一只毛茸茸的白猫坐在餐桌上，看起来完全困惑。我之所以觉得好笑，是因为猫在这种戏剧中表现得如此冷静而无辜，仿佛在想：“你为什么这么生气我坐在这里？”这让我想起我的妹妹露西，有时她在我拿她的蜡笔时会对我大喊，而我只是静静地盯着她，这总是让她更加恼火。极度愤怒和完全无所谓之间的突然对比是如此滑稽，以至于我每次看到都忍不住笑出声。"

Then I tried an augmented-reality stargazing app on my tablet while lying on Hampstead Heath—pointing it at the night sky, constellations and planetary orbits glowed against the real stars, guiding my binocular view and teaching me details about Jupiter’s moons I’d never memorized. Both VR and AR amazed me with their power to blend imagination and reality: VR let me “travel” to ancient worlds I can’t visit, while AR layered unseen information onto my everyday surroundings, deepening my curiosity about nature and the universe.",

Asking for help and following rules are very useful too, but they work best when I first use my own wits to judge what’s happening. When I practiced coding on my tablet, I learned that if I trusted every pop-up without thinking, I would have downloaded things that slowed my device or even put it at risk. By questioning what I saw—“Why does this want my password?”—I avoided trouble. And once I’ve used my brain to decide something might be wrong, I know when to ask my parents or teachers for help or check the school’s safety guidelines. Critical thinking is like a superpower that makes it much easier to do the right thing next.",

I also check for software updates because patches often fix bugs. If none of that helps I ask my dad or Uncle Irvin—he’s really good with technology—to take a deeper look; they might run diagnostics or reinstall the system.

I even wired up a tiny temperature sensor so it could show the day’s high and low on its little LED screen. Then, at home I’ve been using the LEGO WeDo robotics kit: I built a four-wheeled “rover” with a motion sensor that can follow a black line on the floor, and I wrote simple drag-and-drop code to make it stop when it “sees” an obstacle.

        "answer_en": "I once learned more from a Rummikub match than from any toy lesson: that timing and patience can matter more than speed. During one game with Gerald and Leslie I held back a winning tile because I saw Gerald needed to place his own set first—I could’ve won immediately, but instead I chose to help him. He smiled, placed his tiles, then used my tile to finish the game. In that moment I realized teamwork wasn’t just sharing ideas, it was sometimes sacrificing my own moment of glory so that everyone could feel the thrill of success. That taught me to think before acting, to wait for the right moment, and to put the group’s victory above my own.",

My heart pounded every time I thought about it. In the end I decided to wait until I felt braver; that night I wrote in my notebook, “I will tell them soon,” and chose to enjoy our afternoons together at Hampstead Heath instead. A few days later, after one more big chat with Mum and Dad, I invited Chen Jia and Gerald over, took a deep breath, and shared my secret. They listened with wide eyes and accepted me without doubt.

From my earliest days my mother reminded me that a truthful word is worth more than any gift, so I’ve made it a habit to speak up even when I feel shy or scared—like telling them about Hassel rather than hiding it.  They also taught me to be kind without expecting anything back, which I practice by sharing lunch with Luthien, helping my classmates when they struggle, and rescuing cold bumblebees in winter.  Respect for others I show by listening closely when someone speaks, waiting my turn, and apologizing if I ever interrupt or hurt someone’s feelings.  Finally, they’ve drilled into me that responsibility means caring for what’s entrusted to me—so I feed our pets, tidy my room without being asked, and make sure I follow through on every promise, no matter how small.  By living these values every day—at home, at school, and out in the world—I try to honor their lessons and become the kind of person they believe I can be.",

I care about trees because each one is a living library of seasons: its rings hold every warm summer and icy winter it has survived. Animals stir my curiosity and compassion because they remind me that this planet is not mine alone—each fox or bee or whale is part of a vast, delicate puzzle of life, and to lose one piece is to diminish the whole picture. When I picture rivers flowing past mossy banks, I feel as though I’m watching the Earth breathe; I want to protect that breath because clean water is the thread that weaves together every living thing. Knowing that our actions—wasting plastic or cutting down woods—can choke or still that breath makes me determined to learn more, to speak up for the silent voices of the natural world, and to do my small part so that forests, rivers, and all their creatures can continue their timeless dance for generations to come.",

When one of my geckos refused its meal, I learned to watch closely for subtle signs of discomfort and to ask an adult for help when I didn’t know what to do. My parakeets, who trust me to refill their water and clean their cage, showed me patience—gentle hands and quiet voices make them feel safe. Seeing how bees pollinate flowers in the garden reminds me that every creature has its own vital role, and even the smallest life deserves care. Caring for these animals—making sure they’re warm, well-fed and unfrightened—made me kinder, more observant and more determined never to let them down.",

When I learn a new scientific fact—say, how lightning is made of charged particles—I trust the measurements and experiments that prove it. At the same time, I remember that when my great-grandma Orla spoke of spirits or when I see the beauty of a starlit sky, I feel something beyond what science can measure. To reconcile the two, I keep them in separate but complementary boxes: science answers “how” questions and shows me the rules of nature, while spiritual or religious ideas answer “why” questions and guide my values, kindness and wonder. If I ever feel a conflict—such as a belief that sounds unscientific—I ask myself: “What evidence do I have for this? What experiments could I try?” But I also allow myself to hold on to experiences that fill me with awe, comfort or hope even when I can’t explain them in a lab.

I came to this idea when I lay on the grass at Hampstead Heath watching clouds, when I bumped into a raven in Richmond Park and felt my heart pound at the sight of its black wings in the mist, when I splattered paint in Uncle Irvin’s studio and felt my whole body dissolve into color, and most of all when my great-grandmother Orla spoke to me in that dream, offering me the “Light of the Elves” to guide my path.

A trustworthy person, to me, is honest (they don’t tell half-truths), reliable (they do what they say they will), respectful (they don’t mock my feelings or betray my secrets), empathetic (they notice when I’m upset and offer help), and consistent (they behave the same way each time, whether I’m alone or with friends).

Listening to the parables Mom read from the Bible showed me how kindness and honesty can change lives, so I always try to help others.

        "answer_en": "I’ve learned from my family that being generous means sharing not only what we have—books, food, toys—but also our time, our attention and our kindness. I remember Mum making extra bowls of soup just because she knew Mrs. Patel next door was lonely, and Dad quietly slipping his favorite science magazine to Gerald when he was upset, telling him “you’ll find answers in here.” Grandma once knit two scarves in case the cold caught a stranded cat, and Uncle Owen invited me to use his entire art studio whenever I needed a safe corner to pour out my ideas. From them I’ve discovered that generosity — whether it’s my homemade orange marmalade given in little jars at school or my afternoons helping at the care home reading poems to someone who has no visitors—comes from noticing another person’s need and offering a part of yourself, however small. I try to practice it by teaching Leslie how to identify butterflies in the park, by inviting Luthien to share my binoculars when she can’t see the ducks, by spending my pocket money on extra lemonade for friends on hot days and, most of all, by listening and really looking when someone tells me they’re sad or curious. It isn’t grand gestures but these honest, everyday offerings—my hands to help, my voice to comfort, my enthusiasm to spread—that feel like the truest lessons of generosity I’ve ever learned.",
        "answer_ch": "我从家人那里学到，慷慨不仅意味着分享我们所拥有的——书籍、食物、玩具——还包括我们的时间、注意力和善意。我记得妈妈曾为了隔壁的帕特尔太太感到孤独而多做几碗汤，爸爸则在杰拉德情绪低落时默默地把他最喜欢的科学杂志递给他，告诉他“你会在里面找到答案。”奶奶曾为担心冷天气可能困住的流浪猫织了两条围巾，而欧文叔叔邀请我在需要一个安全的地方发泄我的想法时，随时使用他的整个艺术工作室。从他们身上，我发现慷慨——无论是我在学校里用小罐装的自制橘子果酱，还是我在养老院帮助阅读诗歌给没有访客的人——都是来自注意到他人的需求并提供自己的一部分，尽管这可能很微小。我努力通过教莱斯利如何在公园里识别蝴蝶、邀请露西恩分享我的望远镜（当她看不到鸭子时）、在炎热的日子里花自己的零花钱为朋友们买额外的柠檬水，以及最重要的是，倾听并认真观察当有人告诉我他们感到伤心或好奇时，来实践这一点。伟大的举动并不是关键，而是这些诚恳的日常付出——我的手来帮助，我的声音来安慰，我的热情来传播——才是我所学到的最真实的慷慨的教训。"

But I also found that life’s most exciting moments came from stepping beyond that foundation—trying lamb pao mo at the Peruvian stall, exploring the Naadam festival’s horse games, inventing new soap recipes with coffee grounds. So I balanced the two by treating traditions as anchors rather than shackles: I never missed our family rituals, but I always left room in my week for one discovery—be it a new sport, a culture-fest stand, or an impromptu trip to Richmond Park with ten-power binoculars. Before I added something new, I reminded myself why I loved the old—it keeps my roots strong. Then I dove in, curious but respectful, knowing that sometimes the best traditions are those you create by trying something different.",

        "answer_en": "I’ve always believed that honesty is a kind of treasure—it builds trust and keeps my conscience clear—but I’ve also learned that sometimes truth can be like a heavy stone if it serves no purpose but to wound someone. For example, I once blurted out to Samira that her dinner felt too salty without thinking, and seeing her hurt face made me wish I’d found a gentler way to help her improve her recipe. And when I first discovered the secret about Hassor I kept silent around my friends—not because I wanted to lie, but because I wasn’t sure they were ready to hear it and feared it might frighten them. A small “white lie” or choosing quiet can be kinder when the full truth offers no benefit but only pain, like pretending we love someone’s cooking to encourage their confidence. Yet I also know that overusing small untruths can erode trust, so I try to reserve them for moments of genuine kindness. In the end I think honesty should be my default, and I tell the whole truth when it matters for learning or for closer friendship, but a gentle word or silence can sometimes spare someone’s feelings without betraying my principles.",
        "answer_ch": "我一直相信诚实是一种宝藏——它建立信任，让我的良心保持清晰——但我也学到，有时候真相就像一块沉重的石头，如果它的作用只是伤害别人。举个例子，我曾经对萨米拉脱口而出她的晚餐太咸了，没考虑到她的感受，看到她受伤的表情让我希望我能找到一个更温和的方式来帮助她改进食谱。当我第一次发现哈索尔的秘密时，我在朋友面前保持沉默——不是因为我想说谎，而是因为我不确定他们是否准备好听这个，并且担心这会吓到他们。当完全的真相只带来痛苦而没有任何好处时，一句小“小谎”或者选择沉默可能更为善良，就像假装我们喜欢某人的烹饪以鼓励他们的自信一样。然而，我也知道过度使用小谎言可能会侵蚀信任，因此我努力将它们保留在真正善良的时刻。最后，我认为诚实应该是我的默认选择，当关系的学习或亲密时刻重要时，我会说出完整的真相，但有时一个温和的话语或沉默可以避免伤害某人的感情，而不背叛我的原则。"

Most of the time I follow them—I pack my school bag the night before, I tidy my room because Mom says so, and I always close the gecko tank door to keep Leopard and Cleopatra safe. I feel reassured when a teacher reminds us of a rule; it’s a guide rather than a lock. Still, I do question rules that don’t make sense to me. Remember tennis? I tried for a year because Dad wanted me to, but when I couldn’t improve, I sat him down and explained that forcing myself to play made me unhappy and got in the way of my real interests—like cooking and science experiments—and he agreed to let me stop. I don’t see bending rules as mischief so much as finding the healthiest way to live within them. When I’m in Uncle Irvin’s studio, he lets me use whatever “junk” I want to create, showing me that sometimes rules can be flexible to let creativity flow. If a rule ever feels too tight—like preventing me from sharing my discovery of Hassor with Mom and Dad—I ask for permission to explain why I’m different. I’ve learned that authority needn’t be obeyed blindly; it’s best treated as a conversation between two people who care about doing what’s right.",

I remembered how I’d helped Grandma Mary carry her gardening tools back from Kew, and how volunteering in the nursing home fitness class made the residents’ faces light up; those afternoons showing my insect drawings to the residents felt as rewarding as discovering a new beetle species. I’d also baked my first batch of scones for the weekend art fair, imagining how sharing food—my favourite way of giving—could comfort people, and I felt drawn to help at the community kitchen where my mum once cooked for families with little money. More recently I’d begun planting wildflowers in Hampstead Heath to feed bees and butterflies, knowing that saving pollinators was helping farmers and hungry people farther afield. I wanted to plant trees at school with the Rangers and teach younger children the magic of bugs in our insect club, because sharing what I loved with others made their eyes dance with curiosity.

        "question_ch": "你如何利用想象力或讲故事来探讨道德问题或伦理困境？",
        "answer_en": "I often wove little stories in my mind—or even on paper—about the creatures I knew best, using them as heroes or villains in imagined adventures to tease out right and wrong. For example, I once wrote a tale of a brave honeybee who had to decide whether to warn its hive of a looming storm, knowing that leaving its flower patch undefended might let other insects steal the nectar. By picturing the bee’s fear, loyalty and the sacrifice it made, I could explore ideas of duty versus self‐interest. I did the same with my geckos, imagining one deciding whether to share its insect food with a weaker friend or hoard it for itself, and I drew comic‐style panels to show both choices and their consequences. In school I sketched a fable about Orla’s “Light of the Elves,” a guiding flower that tested a child’s honesty: would he use it for selfish gain or return it to someone in need? As I narrated each twist—what I’d do, how the characters felt, what happened next—I found I was practicing empathy, weighing choices in a safe, pretend world. When I played out these scenarios, I could see how small acts of kindness, courage or honesty shaped a better ending than greed or cowardice, so I learned that imagination isn’t just for fun; it’s a rehearsal space for making real moral decisions.",
        "answer_ch": "我常常在脑海中编织小故事，甚至在纸上写下这些故事，关于我最熟悉的生物，把它们当作英雄或反派，进行想象冒险，以探索是非。例如，我曾写过一个关于勇敢蜜蜂的故事，它必须决定是否要警告它的蜂巢即将来临的风暴，知道如果离开花朵区不设防，其他昆虫可能会偷走花蜜。通过想象蜜蜂的恐惧、忠诚和它所做的牺牲，我可以探索责任与自利之间的想法。我对我的壁虎也做了同样的想象，设想其中一个是否要把它的昆虫食物分享给一个更弱的小伙伴，还是为自己囤积，并用漫画风格的面板展示这两种选择及其后果。在学校里，我绘制了一个关于奥拉“精灵之光”的寓言，这是一个考验孩子诚实的引导花：他会将其用于私利，还是将其归还给需要帮助的人？当我叙述每个转折点时——我会怎么做，角色们的感受，以及接下来发生的事情——我发现自己在练习同理心，在一个安全的虚构世界里权衡选择。当我演绎这些情境时，我能够看到微小的善意、勇气或诚实的行为如何塑造出比贪婪或懦弱更好的结局，因此我了解到，想象不仅仅是为了娱乐，它还是进行真实道德决策的排练空间。"

In that friendly soccer match against the Brazilian youth team I saw how a single pass can build trust and lift the whole squad, even if you’re not the one who scores the goal. In Rummikub I’ve learned to share my best tile combinations and cheer on Gerald when he makes a clever move, because our joint wins always taste sweeter. Collaborating with Maeve on our “Contact” art installation taught me how listening to someone else’s wild ideas—like delicate elf-light paper petals—can spark something neither of us could have imagined alone. Helping at the insect club and inviting nursing-home residents to our cultural festivals showed me that community grows when we share what we know and value each person’s voice, no matter their age. Even when I’m the slowest runner in cross-country, cheering my classmates over the finish line and offering a bottle of water means I’ve still played my part. Teamwork isn’t about everyone being the same; it’s knowing how each person’s special gift—whether it’s a perfect pass, a clever move, a delicate paper flower or a bucket of insects—adds to the strength of the whole group. And community is the warm feeling we all share when we learn, create, play and celebrate together.",

I once viewed rules as absolute—“you must follow the rules”—until a new teacher showed me that responsibility and respect matter more than blind obedience. I believed art was only for professionals, yet I discovered that joy and discovery can come from throwing paint wildly on a canvas or fashioning flowers from yarn, simply because you need to express something inside you. I thought secrets were burdens until I shared my encounter with Hassor with my parents and felt the weight lift. And though I still dream of perfect equations or flawless experiments, I’ve learned that embracing mystery—like marveling at a lone raven or a strange dream of my great-grandmother—makes life infinitely richer than chasing “right answers.” These days I value wonder, the courage to follow my own path, and the freedom to make mistakes almost as much as I value knowing the facts.",

My great-grandmother Orla, who faced life’s storms—literally and in her strange gifts—with quiet strength, reminds me that integrity means staying true to yourself, faithful to your beliefs even when others doubt you. And my daddy, who admitted he was wrong about tennis, showed me honesty and self-respect: admitting mistakes takes more courage than hiding them.

So I believe in a balance: save when you have a clear purpose or dream that needs more funds, spend on experiences or tools that help you grow or bring joy to yourself and others, and share with people who need help or will use it to learn or live better. Sharing isn’t only about charity but about recognizing that we all live in a community where helping Grandma with her garden supplies or buying ice cream for a friend makes life warmer for everyone. In the same way, if you save too much it can feel like you’re hoarding stars in the night sky instead of teaching yourself to navigate by them; if you spend too freely you might run out of fuel before you reach the next adventure.

We shouldn’t use animals for unnecessary tests, sport or entertainment, and we should choose cruelty-free products to reduce suffering. Every animal, from my beetles and geckos to the birds I watch in Hampstead Heath, deserves consideration: they are not tools or toys but part of a balanced world. When I care for my pets, I try to imagine how they experience their lives and make choices—like avoiding pesticides and spending time in nature—that respect their autonomy and well-being, because ethical treatment means seeing animals as fellow travelers on this planet, not as objects for our convenience.",

With Chen and Dad I built a model aircraft carrier, each of us tackling different sections—Chen mastered the island superstructure and I assembled the flight deck—then we helped one another correct mistakes. In Rummikub games at home Sophie, Dad and I formed silent partnerships, anticipating each other’s moves so we could clear the board faster. On Saturdays with Gerald we experimented together making soap—he suggested flavors and I timed the saponification process. Even in simple playground games like Snakes & Ladders we shared laughs over ups and downs, cheering each other on rather than competing alone.

At home I planned and cooked breakfast for the family each morning—something I really enjoyed—but if I needed time to work on my beetle collection or paint in Uncle Irvin’s studio I let Mum and Dad know so they wouldn’t worry when I disappeared into my “corner.” With Luthien I shared my toys and games, but I also asked her to give me a little quiet when I was reading about stars or doing my homework. When Chen Jia moved in I had to balance my excitement to show him everything I knew with his need for privacy, so I invited him along to my insect club only after I’d asked if he was free and still gave him space when he needed to nap.

But I also discovered it was better to wait when my own feelings were tangled or the moment wasn’t right—just as I held back from telling Chen Jia or Gerald my secret until I felt calm and certain, because rushing in too quickly might have caused more worry than relief.

It would remind us that curiosity and discovery belong to the whole family. I’d also carry on our Sunday-Roast gatherings but add an extra twist: every month we’d pick a different museum or natural reserve—Natural History, Hampstead Heath, Kew Gardens—and spend the afternoon sketching fossils or staking out butterflies before coming home to roast lamb or tofu and compare field notes. Each spring, I’d start a “Butterfly Garden Day” when we’d plant flowers, log the first brimstones or peacocks, and learn how our small acts can protect pollinators. In winter, on the longest night of December, we’d bundle up for stargazing on our flat roof, just as I once watched meteors with Uncle Irvin, sharing wool blankets and hot cocoa. And of course every Lunar New Year we’d cook dumplings together, hang paper lanterns and try a new recipe from wherever our travels took us—an invitation to discover the world right in our kitchen. I believe these traditions would blend art, nature, culture and science in a way that makes learning joyful and cements our bond.",

It means caring for my family and friends—listening when they need me, sharing what I love (like showing Gerald how to mix spices in a jam), and offering my hand when someone’s hurt or lonely.

In the afternoons I slung my telescope over my shoulder and wandered out to the university’s observatory or across the meadows of Grantchester, tracking Jupiter’s moons and drawing new crater formations on Ganymede’s surface. Weekends found me back home for Sunday Roast with Mum, Dad and Luthien—she’d be in her second year of art school by then—and Gerald and Leslie would often drop by, helping me taste-test my latest lab-made marmalade or homemade whole-wheat bread.

First I’d sketch the design: a 1.5-liter plastic bottle as the fuselage, three fins cut from stiff cardboard for stability and a tapered nose cone from plastic sheeting. Then I’d choose my propellant: water plus compressed air. My hypothesis would be that a 40 percent water fill gives the best mix of mass and thrust, so I’d test water volumes of 20 percent, 40 percent and 60 percent. I’d construct a simple launch tower: a vertical PVC pipe with a tight-fitting cork that has a valve for pumping air. I’d measure air pressure with a bicycle pump gauge and fire each rocket three times at the same pressure—say 2 bar—to gather altitude and distance data. I’d record flight height by marking the highest visible point against a calibrated pole or by timing ascent with a stopwatch and using a chart. I’d also note stability—whether the rocket wobbled or spiraled—so I could refine fin shape or placement. I’d wear safety goggles, stand downwind and use a remote-triggered release so no one’s finger gets pinched. After collecting results I’d graph altitude versus water volume, then draw conclusions: does the data match my hypothesis? Finally I’d redesign the nose cone or add ballast to improve performance and repeat the experiment. This hands-on test of thrust, pressure, mass and aerodynamics would teach me more about physics and rocket engineering than any book alone.",

We’d start in small groups making “buds” by standing in plié with arms folded, then slowly unfurl our bodies and sweep our arms overhead as if petals opening. Next we’d do a raindrop section: quick 1-2 taps of the heels followed by snap-clap movements, arms fluttering like falling droplets. Then a butterfly phrase where each dancer does small jetés with soft arm fluttering to represent wings. After that we’d crouch into a stag-beetle section—wide-leg second position, hands like antennae, shifting side to side in slow, powerful steps.

There, I’d spend hours carefully searching the shale layers for fossil fragments, just as Mary did in the early 1800s, gently brushing away grit to reveal ancient bones. I’d sketch every find in my notebook and record its position on a hand-drawn map. When tide and light were right, I’d show my “discoveries” to an imaginary crowd—pointing out a fluted ammonite or the curved jaw of a long-lost sea reptile—and explain how each fossil unlocks a secret of Earth’s history.

I’ll keep a simple star chart next to my bed and mark each successful practice, then reward myself with a new piece of music or a special snack at the end of each week. I’ll also ask Dad or Mom to check in with me each evening—just a quick “Did you tick your piano star?”—so I stay accountable.

When I’m playing near a road, I choose a spot well away from the kerb, preferably behind a fence or hedge, and I always ask Mum or Dad for permission. They taught me to imagine an invisible safety line that I don’t cross without holding an adult’s hand. I also wear bright clothes so drivers can see me more easily. If I ever feel unsure—if it’s dark, rainy, or there are too many parked cars blocking my view—I don’t go alone. I wait for a grown-up, or I find a safer place, like a park further from the road.

If I’m with Mum or Dad, I hold their hand tightly; they taught me to never let go until we reach the other side. I wait for the “walking man” signal before stepping off the curb, and I keep my eyes on the drivers so they see me—sometimes I make eye contact to know they’ve noticed me. I listen for engines or bicycle bells, too, in case I can’t see around parked cars. I walk straight across, not running or zigzagging, so drivers can predict where I’m going. If there’s no marked crossing, I look for a quieter spot or ask an adult to help. At night I wear light-coloured clothes or carry a bright bag so I’m easier to spot. It feels safer to follow these steps every time because I know I’m doing everything I can to avoid danger.",

Then I’d stay by the bullied child’s side so they’re not alone and guide them to a safe place—perhaps the playground bench—while I find a teacher or playground supervisor to explain exactly what happened. Afterwards I’d check on the kid who was bullied, asking if they’re all right and encouraging them to speak up; I’d also tell my classmates why standing up matters. I’ve seen how Maeve once protected a classmate who was embarrassed, and I know that even a small act of kindness and speaking up can make someone feel less alone and stop the bullying faster.",

For example, when Gerald and I build our “battle” karts out of boxes, we always agree that no one gets tackled harder than a gentle nudge—and if someone thinks we’ve gone too far, we say “stop” and actually stop. I’ve learned that asking “Is this okay?” before a big jump makes a huge difference. If my friend says “too high” or “ouch,” I let go and back off. Sometimes I even count to three in my head before grabbing or climbing on someone, to remind myself to be gentle. If the game gets too rough, I suggest we switch to something else—like a guessing game or building with Legos—so nobody gets hurt and we can still have fun together. And if I accidentally hurt someone, I apologize right away and ask, “Are you all right?” Then I give them space or a little hug if they want it.

I take a few slow, deep breaths to help my head clear and let my heartbeat settle. If I’m still unsteady, I’ll wave over a friend like Gerald or let the coach know so someone can watch over me.

On the monkey bars I gripped each bar firmly with both hands and never swung too fast, keeping my body under control and checking that I could reach the next bar before letting go. I also waited my turn without barging in—if someone else was climbing or sliding I’d hang back and count to ten in my head so I didn’t leap in too soon and risk bumping into them.

Finally, if I feel my face or arms start to glow or tingle—almost as if they’re whispering “I’m hot!”—that’s my cue to seek shade, reapply sunscreen or put on my hat.

When she’s using my binoculars or crayons I’ll find something else to do—read a book or sketch in my notebook—until she’s ready.

Sometimes I simply need to pause and give her room—teeny voices sometimes need a moment to quiet down—so I’ll play outside or check on the fish tank until she waves me back.

At sports practice Coach Dany schedules a “water break” every quarter hour, and I’ve trained myself to pause and drink whenever I adjust my shoelaces or wipe sweat from my brow.

When I use a kitchen knife, I rest the food on a solid cutting board, curl my fingertips under on the hand holding the food so they’re out of the way, and slice with a smooth, deliberate motion. I never rush, and I keep my eyes on the blade at all times. If I’m ever unsure, I stop and ask an adult—Mom, Dad or Uncle Owen—to show me the proper way.

I shut off all screens—tablets, TV, even my digital clock’s bright light—and switch to quiet activities: I usually sketch in my notebook, read a few pages of a nature book or write down any exciting thoughts in my dream journal. Next I wash up—warm water calms me—and put on my soft pajamas. Before climbing into bed, I dim the bedside lamp and talk with Mum about something fun from the day—sometimes she tells me a short story about a star or an animal. By the time I snuggle under my blankets, my mind feels gentle and ready for sleep. Having the same sequence each night—screens off, reading or drawing, hygiene, storytelling—gives my body a signal that it’s time to rest.

I’ve earnt it by doing my regular chores: I make breakfast a few mornings each week (whole‐wheat toast with marmalade if you please), tidy and dust my room every Saturday, fold laundry and put it away, and once in a while help Dad wash the car. Sometimes I prepare picnic lunches for family outings, which they say saves them a lot of time. If I do extra jobs—like weeding the garden at Grandma’s or helping Uncle Owen with odd jobs in his studio—they’ll often slip me a few coins for my “hard work.” Then there are the one‐off treats: birthday cards from Grandma always have a crisp five or ten pound note tucked inside, and at Christmas I usually get a little bonus from Aunt Angela or Uncle Irvin.

First, I made a tiny ledger in my notebook and recorded each monthly £10 as it arrived.

Whenever I want something big—like the fossil set that cost £65—I first work out how many months I need to save and only buy it when I’ve actually got the money. If I ever need to borrow from Mum to pay at the shop—like when I forgot my card—she lets me repay her as soon as I’ve counted my allowance. Dad always reminds me to set aside at least a quarter of any money I earn or receive, both for long-term savings and for sharing with others; for instance, once a term I choose a small charity or animal rescue to receive a donation. Mum matches a small part of my savings when I meet my targets, which makes saving feel rewarding. We try not to buy things on impulse: before spending I ask myself whether it really fits my interests, and sometimes Mum or Dad will gently challenge me if they think I’m rushing into a purchase. On weekends I can earn a little extra by helping with household jobs like washing the car or tidying the garage, and I can then decide if I’ll add that money to my savings jar, spend it on something small, or share part of it with my sister. So the habits we all follow are: think before you spend, save a good portion, and share a little—then you can enjoy your treats without regrets.",

        "answer_en": "One afternoon last summer I stood in the shop window staring at a beautiful fossil specimen box priced at £65. I’d been diligently saving the £10 a month pocket money since my seventh birthday and, by then, had £80 in my account. I felt a rush of excitement imagining those fossils on my shelf – ammonites from the Jurassic, teeth from ancient fish, even a piece of tree petrified over millions of years. Yet I hesitated, thinking of all the other things I might need money for: school trips, new art supplies, or even a family day out at the Natural History Museum.  \n\nI went home and drew up a little budget on a scrap of paper: museum admission, art supplies, savings for Devon holiday, and that fossil box. The numbers told me I could still cover everything if I spent the £65, but my impulsive voice argued I should wait and save more. I remembered how much joy I felt discovering fossils on our Devon vacation and how they sparked my curiosity in evolution. That made my decision clear: investing in my own learning and wonder was more important than holding out for something smaller later.  \n\nSo I asked my mum to buy the box for me, planning to repay her pocket money over the next two months. The moment I unwrapped it at home, I knew I’d made the right choice. My fossils weren't just pretty rocks – they were reminders of why I love science, and sometimes it’s worth spending your savings on what feeds your curiosity.",

We hung up charts showing butterflies, dragonflies, mosses and ladybirds; I showed passers-by how to use my 10× binoculars to spot kingfishers and sparrowhawks; and we recorded every creature we saw in a big notebook. Families from the neighbourhood joined in, kids did hand-prints on a big map to mark where they’d found newts or wildflowers, and I helped tally the totals for each species. By the end of the day we’d logged over thirty different insects, a pair of grebes on the lake and two muntjac deer bounding through the undergrowth.

I sorted the litter into recycling and general waste bins at the car park while Dad pointed out a pair of sandpipers feeding safely in the tideline we had cleared.

A piggy-bank was like a friendly treasure chest at home: every coin I dropped in made a satisfying clink and reminded me I was moving closer to my goal, so I was less tempted to spend on impulse; it also taught me to count and plan, because I had to see exactly how many coins I’d collected before deciding what to buy.

If two brands cost the same but one has thicker paper or organic oats, I’ll choose that one even if it’s not the fanciest label. For toys or tools I’ll ask: will it last a long time? I once compared two sets of coloured pencils—one cheaper brand snapped in half after a week so I saved up for the better-known set that’s held up for months. Sometimes a trusted brand name is worth the extra pence if you know their products rarely break or go out of stock. Finally, I check the total cost against my pocket money or family budget.

At the end of each week I add up the “–” entries and move that total into the Spent jar, so whatever’s left in the Left jar must be truly mine to keep.

        "answer_en": "I usually treat it like a little experiment in my notebook: first I make a mental list of Pros and Cons—Pros of Fun: instant happiness; learning about what I really enjoy; a small reward for hard work; Cons of Fun: I might use money I need later; new toys sometimes lose their magic. Pros of Saving: I build toward something I really need or value; I feel proud of my self-control; Cons of Saving: it takes patience; I miss out on simple pleasures now. Once I’ve thought it through, I talk it over with Mum or Dad—explaining which item I’d buy for fun, why I like it, and what more important goal I’m saving for. They often ask questions: “How much will each cost?” “Could you split your allowance into ‘fun’ and ‘savings’ jars?” Together we find a compromise—maybe I spend half now and save half—or delay the fun purchase until I’ve reached a savings target. This way I learn to balance immediate joy with future rewards and never feel I’ve made the wrong choice.",

        "answer_en": "I’ve learned that borrowing and lending money works best when everyone agrees on the rules up front—just like when I lend Gerald my Rummikub tiles or borrow Conrad’s colored pencils. First, we always ask “How much and when?” so there are no surprises: I say, “May I borrow £2 for a snack today? I’ll pay you back after school,” and they’ll set a repayment time that suits them. Second, we write it down on a little note—an IOU—that we both sign, even if it’s on a scrap of paper, so we remember. Third, I thank them warmly and treat their money as if it were my own: I don’t waste it on lollipops I don’t need but spend it carefully so I really can repay them. If I can’t pay back exactly when promised, I explain why—“My pocket money ran out because I bought extra jam for Mom’s birthday gift”—and agree a new date together. That way no one feels angry or let down. In my family I’ve seen Dad and Mum do the same when they share tools: they always remind each other to wipe them clean and return them promptly, and that makes everyone trust each other more. So fair borrowing means clear agreement, a written promise, careful use, honest updates and prompt returns—then everyone feels comfortable and treated fairly.",

I’ve found that by budgeting ten pounds each month and saving any birthday or holiday money, I can usually afford fees without asking for more. If dues ever go higher than my allowance, I’d talk it over with my parents and see if I could run a little fundraiser—like a bake sale or making extra marmalade jars to sell—so I learn both responsibility and a bit of entrepreneurship. In return, I expect clear communication about what the dues cover—equipment use, coaching sessions, field trips, competition fees—and fair access to all the activities. I’d also hope for a respectful, encouraging environment where I can improve my skills, make new friends and have a voice in decisions that affect the group.

Over Ramadan and Easter Mum and Dad have set up jars where we drop in coins every day, then use the total to donate or treat ourselves as a reminder that money can help others or bring shared joy.
