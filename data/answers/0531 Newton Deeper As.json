        "question_ch": "你出生于2016年12月25日——你的父母告诉你他们是如何选择你的生日的，以及你们每年是如何庆祝它的？",
        "answer_en": "My parents always told me that they didn’t actually choose my birthdate—it was simply a surprise Christmas morning arrival after Mum went into labour on Christmas Eve—yet they’ve always loved how my birthday fell on December 25th so that every year our celebrations blend Christmas joy with birthday fun. They say Dad stayed up late wrapping presents only to dash to the hospital at dawn and find me already eager to join the world. Ever since, our family tradition is to start Christmas Day with the usual stockings, crackers and tree lights at breakfast, then Mum brings out a small birthday cake for me before lunch, and after our big festive roast with grandparents we shift from carols to “Happy Birthday,” complete with personalised blue-and-green decorations in my room. I get to choose my birthday flavour treats—last year it was dark chocolate scones—and at night we leave cookies not just for Santa but also for me. They say sharing Christmas and my birthday means our home sparkles all December, and I couldn’t agree more.",
        "answer_ch": "我父母总是告诉我，他们其实并没有选择我的生日——这只是一个圣诞早晨的惊喜，妈妈在平安夜开始临产——但他们一直很喜欢我的生日恰好在12月25日，这样每年的庆祝活动都能将圣诞节的快乐与生日的乐趣结合在一起。他们说爸在忙着包礼物熬夜，结果清晨赶到医院时发现我已经迫不及待想要来到这个世界。自那以后，我们的家庭传统是在圣诞节当天早晨以平常的 stockings、烟花和树灯开始，然后妈妈在午餐前为我拿出一个小蛋糕，之后在和祖父母的大餐之后，我们从圣歌转向“生日快乐”，房间里还有蓝色和绿色的个性化装饰。我可以选择我生日的口味美食——去年是黑巧克力松饼——晚上我们不仅为圣诞老人留饼干，也留给我。他们说分享圣诞和我的生日意味着我们的家在整个12月都闪耀，我完全同意。",

        "question_ch": "您的出生地列为基尤西部的西米德尔塞克斯大学医院，您对那个医院或那片地区有什么了解？",
        "answer_en": "West Middlesex University Hospital stands in the suburb of Isleworth, just west of Kew, on the A310 Twickenham Road, not far from the River Thames and the green expanse of Syon Park. It’s part of the Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust and, as the nearest large maternity unit for families living around Kew Gardens, it’s where I was born. I know it’s a busy place with a tall brick building and a glass-fronted extension, where my parents once walked in with Dad guiding Mum down the gentle slope of the hospital drive. The surrounding neighbourhood feels more residential than central London – rows of terraced houses, small shops, and plane trees lining quiet streets – yet you can catch glimpses of the Hounslow skyline in the distance. On our way back from grandparents’ visits or trips to Richmond Park we’ve sometimes passed the hospital by bus 237, nodding at the vivid murals above the entrance. Though I haven’t had cause to go inside since I was a baby, I imagine its corridors filled with families waiting to meet their new babies, much as I once lay there on Christmas Day when I was born.",
        "answer_ch": "西米德尔塞克斯大学医院位于艾尔斯沃斯郊区，靠近基尤，坐落在A310特威肯汉姆路上，离泰晤士河和西昂公园的绿地不远。它是切尔西和威斯敏斯特国民医疗服务信托基金的一部分，作为居住在基尤公园附近家庭的最近大型产科单位，这里就是我出生的地方。我知道这里是一个繁忙的地方，有一栋高大的砖砌建筑和一个玻璃前面扩建的部分，我的父母曾在这里走进来，爸爸引导着妈妈走下医院平缓的车道。周围的邻里感觉比伦敦中心更具住宅气息——排成行的联排房屋、小商店、和沿着宁静街道的梧桐树——然而，你仍然可以在远处瞥见亨斯洛的天际线。在我们从祖父母家或里士满公园返回的路上，有时我们乘坐237路公交车经过医院，点头致意于入口上方生动的壁画。虽然我自婴儿时期以来没有理由再进入医院，但我想象医院的走廊里挤满了等着见新生儿的家庭，就像我出生时圣诞节那天躺在这里的情景。",

        "question_ch": "你的生肖是猴子——你觉得你的个性与猴子的特征有何联系？",
        "answer_en": "I often notice that my love of curiosity and playful mischief feels very “monkey-like.” Monkeys are famous for exploring every nook and cranny and for trying new tricks, and I do exactly that—whether I’m inventing messy paint experiments in Uncle Owen’s studio, rigging up homemade kites on Hampstead Heath or figuring out how many butterfly species I can spot on a single walk. Like a monkey, I’m quick to learn: I pick up Chinese characters or cooking techniques fast, and I spring from one passion to the next without hesitation. I also enjoy lighthearted pranks—nothing mean, just enough to make my friends laugh—and I adapt easily when plans change, whether it’s swapping tennis lessons for hiking or turning a rainy picnic into a living-room movie night. My energy, my cheeky sense of humor and my eagerness to leap into every new adventure remind me why the Monkey is said to be clever, sociable and endlessly curious—and that feels just right.",
        "answer_ch": "我常常注意到，我对好奇和顽皮捣蛋的热爱感觉非常“像猴子”。猴子以探索每个角落和尝试新花样而闻名，而我正是这样——无论是在欧文叔叔的工作室里发明搞砸的油漆实验，还是在汉普斯特德希思公园制作自制风筝，或是在一次散步中找出我能看到多少种蝴蝶。像猴子一样，我学习很快：我能迅速掌握汉字或烹饪技巧，并毫不犹豫地从一个兴趣转到另一个。我也喜欢轻松的恶作剧——没有恶意，只是让朋友们笑的程度——当计划改变时，我也能轻松适应，无论是把网球课换成徒步旅行，或是把一个下雨的野餐变成客厅电影之夜。我的精力、顽皮的幽默感和跃入每个新冒险的渴望让我明白为什么猴子被说成聪明、善交际和无尽好奇——这感觉正合适。",

        "question_ch": "你的西方星座是摩羯座——你有没有读过关于摩羯座的资料，你觉得那些描述符合你吗？",
        "answer_en": "I have read that Capricorns are often described as responsible, disciplined and serious, with a strong sense of duty and a preference for planning over spontaneity. I think some of those traits fit me—I do enjoy making detailed picnic plans, following through on breakfast chores and carefully studying fossils, and I’m quite sensitive when someone criticizes my ideas. Yet I’m also more curious and playful than that description suggests, and I love animated shows, unexpected adventures with Gerald or Leslie and spirited conversations with my family. So while I share Capricorn’s sense of responsibility and love of order, I don’t think I’m as reserved or solely work-focused as the stereotype implies; I need balance, creativity and laughter just as much as I need a carefully drawn to-do list.",
        "answer_ch": "我了解到，摩羯座通常被描述为负责任、守纪律和严肃，具有强烈的责任感，更倾向于规划而非自发。我认为这些特质中的一些适合我——我确实喜欢制定详细的野餐计划，完成早餐的家务活，认真研究化石，对别人批评我的想法非常敏感。然而，我也比这个描述更好奇和顽皮，我喜欢动画节目、与杰拉德或莱斯利的意外冒险以及与家人的热烈对话。因此，虽然我有摩羯座的责任感和对秩序的热爱，但我不认为我像刻板印象所暗示的那样内向或仅专注于工作；我同样需要平衡、创造力和欢笑，就像我需要一份精心绘制的待办事项清单一样。",

        "answer_en": "I have blood type O. At home we seldom discussed blood types but Mum, who works at the hospital, once explained the ABO system after I asked why my sister dreaded blood tests. She told me Type O is the universal donor and in emergencies can be given to anyone. Dad then read me a story from World War II when medics carried O-type blood in portable carriers to treat wounded soldiers of all blood groups. Later Gerald’s mum, who is Japanese, said people in Japan treat blood types like personality types and Type O are thought to be confident, generous leaders—a fun idea but not science, Mum reminded me. Aunt Irene, the marine biologist, added that only O negative is truly universal, so real donors of that type become heroes in trauma units. I felt proud knowing my O blood could help save lives.",
        "answer_ch": "我血型是O型。在家里我们很少讨论血型，但妈妈在医院工作，有一次我问她为什么我姐姐害怕抽血，她解释了ABO系统。她告诉我O型是通用献血者，在紧急情况下可以给任何人使用。然后爸爸给我讲了一个二战的故事，讲述了医护人员如何携带O型血在便携式容器中治疗所有血型的伤员。后来杰拉尔德的妈妈是日本人，她说日本人将血型视为性格类型，O型被认为是自信、慷慨的领导者——这是个有趣的想法，但妈妈提醒我这不是科学。伊琳阿姨，海洋生物学家，补充说只有O型阴性是真正的通用型，所以这种血型的真正献血者在创伤科成为英雄。我感到自豪，因为我的O型血可以帮助拯救生命。",

        "question_ch": "你就读于贝尔赛斯圣乔治小学——与其他你访问过的学校相比，你的学校有什么特别之处？",
        "answer_en": "What makes Belsize St George so special is that it sees the whole world as part of our classroom: every month we choose a continent or culture and transform the school—from the corridors to the playground—into a living map with food stalls, music, dance, calligraphy, costumes and even pop‐up “mini-museums” run by our older neighbours. Once a year our entire school dedicates a week to art, with every hallway, lawn and classroom hosting paintings, sculptures and performances created by pupils and teachers side by side. We share our learning with local residents—grandparents from the nearby care home co-teach science experiments, lead poetry readings and join us for PE in the garden—and we visit art galleries, factories and wildlife reserves as part of normal lessons. Our teachers don’t just stand at the front of a classroom: they take us rock-climbing, share their own research in neuroscience or marine biology, dress up as pirates for geography day or teach Chinese poetry in a handmade yurt. Everywhere you turn there’s a chance for hands-on discovery, whether you’re exploring insects in the park, making soap in a real factory or cooking lamb paomo with a visiting chef from Xi’an—and that sense of seeing learning as a grand, shared adventure is something I’ve never felt so strongly at any other school.",
        "answer_ch": "贝尔赛圣乔治学校之所以特别，是因为它将整个世界视为我们的课堂：每个月我们选择一个大洲或文化，并将学校——从走廊到操场——变成一个活生生的地图，设置美食摊位、音乐、舞蹈、书法、服装，甚至还有由我们年长的邻居们运营的快闪“小型博物馆”。每年，我们整个学校有一周的时间专注于艺术，每条走廊、草坪和教室都展示学生和教师共同创作的绘画、雕塑和表演。我们与当地居民分享我们的学习——邻近养老院的祖父母共同授课科学实验，主持诗歌朗读，并和我们一起在花园里参加体育课——同时，我们在正常课程中参观艺术画廊、工厂和野生动物保护区。我们的教师不仅仅是站在教室前面：他们带我们攀岩，分享他们在神经科学或海洋生物学方面的研究，为地理日打扮成海盗，或者在手工的圆顶屋内教授中国诗歌。无论你在哪里，总有机会进行动手探索，无论是在公园里观察昆虫、在真实的工厂里制作肥皂，还是与来自西安的客座厨师一起烹饪羊肉泡馍——这种将学习视为一场宏大、共同冒险的感觉，是我在其他任何学校都从未感受过的。",

        "answer_en": "One afternoon Gerald and I spotted a motionless squirrel on the grass and while everyone rushed to call the teacher I calmly crouched beside it, noted its breathing, checked for visible wounds and gently lifted it using my handkerchief so as not to burn its fur. I examined its limbs for swelling, then fetched water and a few peanuts from our snack, offered them to the squirrel and watched its response, all the while explaining each factual observation—no bleeding, steady breathing, able to grip the peanut—in order to decide whether it needed further help or could be released. By stating each fact clearly and following what I knew about animal first aid, we avoided panicking, cared for the squirrel correctly and finally set it safely back in a nearby tree.",

Once, when Gerald and I rescued a shivering baby squirrel together, I saw how carefully he held it and how nervous he’d been, so I looked him in the eye and told him, “Gerald, you’re the kindest animal friend anyone could have.” His whole face lit up and he told me afterward that hearing those words made him feel proud and brave in a way he’d never felt before.",

Instead of pretending not to notice, I slid my tray beside him and quietly asked if he’d like to join Dad and me for afternoon tea at the café, where we always have warm scones and tea. He hesitated at first, then managed a small smile and agreed. As we walked there, I gently asked about his family back in Xi’an and listened as he told me how much he missed his mum’s cooking. Over tea I shared stories about my sister’s marmalade toast and my grandparents’ Sunday roast, and he began to laugh and talk about his own favourite foods. By the end of the week he was smiling more at school and even introduced me to a Chinese crossword puzzle app he’d found. I was glad my simple kindness had helped him feel a little more at home.",

I asked gentle questions like “What’s on your mind?” instead of jumping straight to advice, and I repeated back what they’d said to show I’d really heard them. Then I reminded them of a time they’d overcome something similar or shared a small story of when I’d felt low and what helped me—often drawing a picture of the problem, which made it less scary. I offered a concrete, manageable idea—“Shall we take a short walk and count the birds?”—so they could feel an immediate sense of action. I ended by giving genuine praise for anything they’d done, no matter how small, and letting them know it was okay to feel down but that I believed they would feel better again.",

No one else seemed to notice it wasn’t a natural feather marking but a simple plastic ring used in bird-tracking studies.

That odd question set my imagination racing, so I gathered a large sheet of cardboard, some colored pencils and pebbles, and set about inventing a new board game I called “Interstellar Insect Quest.” I drew a winding path through the Solar System, marked off squares for Earth, Mars, Jupiter’s storms and the asteroid belt, and made rules about collecting stardust and dodging solar flares. I used bits of colored glass for playing pieces—pearl white for the moon beetle, rusty red for the Mars stag—and wrote instructions that considered gravity, speed and even cactus thorns. When Gerald and Leslie arrived, they loved the idea so much we ended up spending the entire afternoon playing and then arguing over whether a comet’s tail should slow you down or hasten you forward. By the end of the day I had rewritten the rulebook twice, but more importantly I realised that a single spark of curiosity in my mind could lead me to create something completely new and surprisingly fun.",

I counted slowly from one to five in my mind, matching each count to a deep breath, so that by the time I reached five, I was breathing evenly again. Then I reminded myself of one clear fact: what I was seeing or feeling was real and describable. I named what I saw, what I heard, even what I felt in my hands or feet, as if I were explaining it to someone else. Turning my mind toward simple, true details helped me hold onto calm.  \n\nIn louder, more chaotic moments—like when Gerald pushed me at school and I felt my anger rise—I pictured a clear glass of water. I told myself that if I stayed still, the water inside would settle and become clear again. I practiced that quietly in my head: stillness, clarity, calm. I also trusted that if I spoke slowly and chose each word, I could shape the moment rather than be swept away by it.  \n\nI learned these tricks from watching my mother face emergencies as a doctor.

In Uncle Owen’s studio corner I measured every part with a ruler and calipers: the flight deck had to be exactly 250 mm long, the island superstructure glued perfectly at a 7° angle to port. I mixed paint to match official dove-grey and waterline-red, then applied twenty thin coats to avoid drips. I printed tiny J-15 fighter decals, cut and placed each of the thirty-six planes at their correct positions, even scaled the landing-strip markings to within half a millimeter of accuracy. I studied overhead photos to align the radar mast, lifeboats and CIWS turrets, cleaning stray glue with a toothpick.

But the real test came a few months later when that same boy, Kirk Fraser, began taunting Maeve in the corridor—everyone else edged away or jeered, but I calmly stepped between them and told Kirk, “I won’t allow you to speak to her like that,” and stood my ground until he backed off. I wasn’t the biggest or the loudest, but I knew that cruelty couldn’t be met with bullying of my own, so I spoke with a steady voice and simply expected everyone to treat each other with kindness.

He once grabbed jars of paint and, furious at how my classmates had treated me, hurled colors across a huge canvas, turning his anger into swirls of red, blue and yellow. He didn’t sketch first or plan a design—he simply let his emotions guide his arms. Watching that, I realized art could be a way to pour out everything inside me instead of forcing shapes to look perfect. So one afternoon I claimed a corner of his studio, gathered scraps of cardboard, twine and old soda bottles, and flung dollops of paint across the cardboard until it felt like my own storm of feelings. I even pressed in twigs and pebbles without measuring, just following how hot or cold I felt in the moment. It was messy and nothing like a neat drawing, but it made me feel free, and every time I look at that chaotic piece I remember Uncle Owen’s fearless joy in creation.",

I also record myself on my tablet reading simple Japanese fairy tales, then listen back to my own voice on the way to school, which makes my sentences sound more natural.

My birthday never fell on a quiet day—our living room sparkled with tinsel and balloons at once, and from Christmas Eve dinners at Grandma’s through to the big family roast on the 26th, every relative seemed to turn up with gifts and cheerful smiles. I loved that I woke up on the world’s happiest morning, with double presents and double cakes, but sometimes I also wondered if my birthday got lost in all the carols and Christmas decorations.

        "answer_en": "I was born in the Year of the Monkey and I noticed many qualities in myself that other Monkeys were said to share. Monkeys were described as curious and clever so I saw it in my own eagerness to explore every rock in Hampstead Heath with my magnifier and in the way I puzzled through math problems at school. Monkeys were known to be playful and sociable and I remembered how I laughed with Maeve when she defended that boy in kindergarten or how I plotted with Gerald to rescue a squirrel. Monkeys were said to be adaptable and quick-witted so I recalled learning new Japanese phrases from Mom almost overnight during our trip to Japan and finding my way through complex origami instructions. Monkeys were mischievous and inventive so I recognized it in the time I covered my bedroom wall in paint to express my anger and in the contraptions I built in Uncle Owen’s studio. Monkeys were agile and full of energy and I felt it every time I raced Lucy across the playground or my legs tingled after a long hike in Dorset. And Monkeys were always observant so I remembered noting every detail of a robin’s nesting behavior or wanting to share my insect counts at supper. I felt proud that these traits made me who I was—curious, lively, adaptable, and forever wanting to learn something new.",

Sometimes I’ll prop my notebook open on the sofa and run through my diagrams aloud, tapping the page with my handkerchief whenever I want to emphasize something.

I watch her constantly for signs of tiredness or frustration—if her laughter fades or her steps slow I pause our game for a snack or water, and if she wants to climb too high on the sofa I suggest a lower stump for her throne. When she’s painting on the wall I hand her a mat and a bucket of soapy water for quick clean-ups, and if she draws something I can’t identify I ask her to explain so her little face lights up telling me about “Elfin flowers” from her imagination.

        "answer_en": "I noticed that being “me” meant different things in grandpa’s living room than on the playground, so I tuned in to what each person in front of me seemed to need. With my grandparents I tried to be patient, curious and respectful—I asked about Grandma’s lace-making, sat quietly while Grandpa told stories of Ireland, helped fold laundry or stir soup. I chose my calmest self because they seemed to treasure a good listener who would honour their memories and wisdom. With my friends I let my more energetic side show up: my racing heart for new experiments, my wild ideas for art, my jokes about dinosaurs or space probes. I knew Gerald enjoyed my dramatic reenactments, Leslie liked my facts about kites or algebra, and Maeve valued my freckle-face laughter when things got too serious. In both places I still stayed honest and generous, but I turned the volume up on empathy and gentleness with my grandparents, and on imagination and playful challenge with my classmates. Often I made my choice without thinking: if Grandma smiled because I helped clear the table, I kept helping; if Gerald brightened when I showed him a new sketch, I grabbed my pencils. Over time I learned that personality isn’t a fixed mask but a toolbox—when I wanted to build trust and remember the past, I used my patient tools; when I wanted to invent and explore, I opened the lively drawers. In the end it wasn’t a deliberate act of pretending but simply caring enough to offer each person what I saw they needed in me.",

If things get too heated, one of us will wander off—she might fling herself onto the sofa, I’ll poke around in “my corner” of the studio—until we both cool down. Then one of us will come back and say, “Tell me again why you felt hurt,” or “Help me see your side.” Once we’ve really listened, we usually make up by doing something we both love—sometimes it’s whipping up breakfast together (she handles the marmalade, I fry the eggs), other times we’ll crank up a favorite song and dance in the kitchen until we’re both laughing.

I would sit beside her on the carpet, lay out the board, show her how to roll the dice and count each square aloud, and patiently guide her hand on her first few moves. When I introduced a new twist—say, earning a second turn for landing on a six—I demonstrated it on my own token, talking her through every step, then encouraged her to try it herself until she understood. Whenever she hesitated I broke the rule down into even simpler parts and let her practice those alone, praising her bravery each time she mastered a new rule. To introduce fresh activities I once built a pillow-fort obstacle course: I sketched a simple map on paper, walked her through each challenge, then quietly watched as she navigated the cushions and low tables on her own.

Once she’d told me why she was upset, I’d remind her how brave she was, tell her a tiny part of a princess story we both loved, and suggest we take three deep breaths together—slow in through the nose and out through the mouth—to help her body relax. I remember clearly one afternoon in Richmond Park when she was trembling after a startled deer had bounded too close. I crouched beside her, wrapped my arm around her shoulders, and pointed out a blue tit flitting nearby, asking her to count how many times it hopped between branches. As she whispered “one… two… three,” her breathing evened out, her tears stopped, and by the time the bird flew off I saw her shoulders relax and her lips quirk into a shy smile—then we walked home hand in hand, and she told me she felt safe again.",

        "answer_en": "I always woke Luthien at dawn with a ribbon in her hair and her favorite whole-wheat toast ready—her birthday breakfast became my proudest chore ever. We’d set the kitchen table with her tiny pink plates and a pile of storybooks about princesses, and I’d show her my latest marmalade-jam experiment, letting her pick her favorite flavour. Then I’d whisk her off to Hampstead Heath or Kew Gardens for our “sister’s tea party in the wild,” where I’d secretly hide little felt flowers I’d made among the blooms so she could discover them on our walk. Back home, I’d take charge of the invitations—hand-drawing each one with tiaras and unicorns—and draw up our party schedule, from “dress-up parade” to “royal dance-off.” As the guests arrived, I’d guide our homemade photo booth (a blanket strung between two trees) and hand out props—flower crowns for the girls, cardboard swords for the boys—while Luthien beamed in her favourite white dress. My special role was always “chief happiness engineer,” making sure every game, every ribbon and jam-topped scone, felt perfectly tailored to her princess-of-the-day dreams.",

I remembered how Maeve refused to join in when the boy in kindergarten soiled himself and how everyone respected her for it, so I told Luthien that story. Because she adores princess tales, I asked, “What would a kind princess do if she saw someone ashamed?” and she immediately said she’d help them feel better. I spoke in a gentle voice, used words she already knew, and linked the lesson to something she loves, so she grasped the idea of compassion right away.",

Her instinct to speak up for someone smaller than herself, without worrying what other kids think, reminds me that real courage isn’t about muscles or speed but about standing by your convictions. To help her keep growing, I make sure to celebrate every small act of kindness she does—thanking her warmly, giving her the first choice of bedtime stories that night, or drawing her a little “justice star” next to her name on our family chart. I also share stories of people I admire—like Maeve from arts club who defended her classmates, or Rosa Ridley’s fearless tennis spirit—to show Luthien that speaking up is a strength heroes share.

On another occasion we both wanted to sit in the front seat of Dad’s car, so we drew names from a hat and promised the loser the next time—and because Luthien trusted me to keep my promise, she accepted. From those experiences I learned that small timers, simple games of chance and keeping track of promises help us trade toys or privileges without tears; most important, I discovered that saying “I’m sorry” when I felt unfair and “thank you” when she yielded made our compromises feel like teamwork rather than defeat.",

        "answer_en": "When Luthien tackles something new, I first sit beside her and break the task into small, clear steps—whether it’s tying shoelaces, a new dance move or learning a Chinese character—then demonstrate each step slowly and let her try. I encourage her by naming every small success: “Great loop!” or “Well done on that stretch!” and only offer help when she truly needs it, so she builds confidence. I cheer her on, clap when she masters a bit more and sometimes we time her sprints together, recording each run in my notebook so she can see her own progress. Most importantly, I listen to how she feels—if she’s frustrated I remind her of how many times I scrambled eggs before I could do it without a burn. In the process I learn patience—I discover how different teaching is from learning, how explaining slows me down and deepens my own grasp of simple skills, and how empathy grows when I see the world through her wide-eyed curiosity. Supporting Luthien reminds me that every learner’s pace is unique and that real understanding comes when you guide someone gently but let them find the strength to do it themselves.",
        "answer_ch": "当露西恩尝试新事物时，我首先坐在她身边，将任务分解成小而清晰的步骤——无论是系鞋带、新舞步还是学习汉字——然后慢慢示范每一步，让她尝试。我通过称赞每一个小成功来鼓励她：“做得好！”或“这个伸展做得很棒！”只有在她真的需要帮助时才提供支持，这样她才能建立自信。我为她加油，掌声鼓励她掌握更多，有时我们一起计时她的冲刺，并在我的笔记本中记录每次跑步，以便她能看到自己的进步。最重要的是，我倾听她的感受——如果她感到沮丧，我会提醒她在我能做到不烫手之前煮了多少次鸡蛋。在这个过程中，我学会了耐心——我发现教学与学习的不同，解释使我放慢速度，深化我对简单技能的理解，而当我通过她好奇而宽广的视野看世界时，同情心也在增长。支持露西恩让我意识到，每个学习者的节奏都是独特的，真正的理解来自于温柔地引导他人，但也让他们找到自己行事的力量。",

In those moments my heart seemed to swell bigger than my ribcage, as if I’d discovered an entirely new continent inside me. I’d scoop her up in a tight hug, whispering “You did it!” into her hair, and she’d laugh that bright, tinkling laugh that made our whole living room feel like it was lit from within. Then we’d turn the achievement into a small celebration—her choice of treat (maybe a scone with Devonshire cream or a scoop of ice cream), a homemade certificate I’d draw with my 24-colour pencils, and often a quick dance-around-the-room to her favourite tune. If it was something truly big, we’d tell Mum and Dad over afternoon tea, and sometimes I’d add her name and the date to our stair-well “art wall” so everyone who visits can see just how far my little sister has leapt—quite literally, sometimes—because every first is a treasure worth remembering together.",

He even remembers having to learn geography from paper maps taped to his bedroom wall and labelling them himself with coloured pencils.  I find it amazing that a decade ago anyone could get through school without typing a single word on a screen or tapping a search bar—everything had to be written longhand or looked up in those enormous tomes.

I remember him practicing Chinese characters with me at the kitchen table as a toddler, patiently guiding my hand across each stroke and insisting I say “谢谢” instead of “thanks.” When I was five he brought home French picture books and we spent Sundays hunting for “le chat” in every illustration, and at six he surprised me with a Spanish song he’d learned so we could sing together. Last year he started taking evening classes in Japanese, and I joined him in tracing kana in my notebook, copying his disciplined habit of looking up every new word. Watching him slip seamlessly from one language to another made me believe it was natural to speak four tongues, not a strange feat. His enthusiasm for the sounds, the stories and even the mistakes he made along the way taught me that learning a language was like making friends with another corner of the world. Because he never treated any language as “too hard” for me, I never thought I was too young to learn Chinese, French, Spanish or Japanese, and that confidence has carried me through every new phrase I’ve picked up.",

That tale stayed with me and sent me hunting for other moon myths: I read about Selene and Endymion in Greek stories, Tsukuyomi in Japan, the Man in the Moon in Europe, and even lunar legends from the Maya.

At dinner he taught me to sketch a simple timetable: block out fixed commitments—school, piano practice or nature walks—then slot in homework and reading in bite‐size sessions, with short breaks for fresh air or sketching. He warned me that spreading myself too thin made every task feel half-done, so he urged “single-tasking,” finishing one assignment before starting the next. Whenever I fretted about exams, he reminded me that passion was the best motivation—if I chose the right order for my tasks, based on what interested me most, I’d find the energy to keep going.

        "answer_en": "My father often asked me to be his “young consultant” when he planned his Chinese language lessons: he’d sketch out a new vocabulary topic or cultural story on his desk at home and invite me to point out which words or examples I found boring or confusing, and which surprised or delighted me. Sometimes he’d test me on idioms he was about to teach, then ask, “How would you explain this to a friend who’s never heard it before?” Other times he’d let me help him choose illustrations for his slides—my job was to spot pictures that made me curious enough to ask questions, because he knew that if I was intrigued, his students would be too. From these sessions I learned that good teaching isn’t just about knowing the material but about thinking carefully how each word, each image, each activity feels to someone encountering it for the first time. I saw how much patience and creativity it takes to turn a dry list of characters into a memorable story, and I learned the power of asking “Why?”—not only to understand a lesson but to shape one that makes others eager to learn.",

Once, when I explained that forcing me to practise tennis every Saturday was making me resent sport, Dad admitted he’d been listening to his own wishes instead of mine and stopped that rule altogether.

Sometimes she wove those moments into our family tapestry, recalling how her own grandmother Orla once said you could “hear the roses bloom” if you listened closely enough—and I’d imagine petals unfurling in the dark. Other nights she’d slip into a story about my father as a boy, hiking through Ireland’s fields in search of fairies, proudly bearing tales of his first fossil discovery.

The first patient was an elderly man with a deep cough; I watched Mum place her stethoscope on his back, listen attentively, then look up and explain in calm, simple language how his antibiotics were helping. When a young mother fretted over her toddler’s fever, Mum crouched to the child’s level, offered a toy lion for comfort and showed the mother how to use a digital thermometer properly. Between patients I noticed Mum exchanging quick jokes with the nurse at the station, comparing notes on blood test results, then pausing to wash her hands with that special hospital soap we keep at home.

She showed me how to sort the appointment cards, check that each file had the correct blood‐pressure readings and blood tests attached, and sterilize the small ear examination instruments before she wound their cords neatly and placed them in the tray. At first I thought a doctor’s work was only about prescribing medicine or giving injections, but standing beside her as she methodically ticked off names and gently folded each file made me realise how much careful planning and quiet care goes into every consultation. Watching her balance so many tasks—reassuring a worried grandmother, explaining inhaler techniques to a young asthmatic, and still smiling while she washed her hands for the next patient—taught me that being a doctor is as much about attention to detail and steady kindness as it is about knowing science.

He spent a week living in a tiny guesthouse, rising at dawn to speak with elderly villagers, then in the afternoon drafting compromise proposals, and by evening negotiating with county officials in candlelit rooms. He described how he learned to listen more than he spoke, to weigh everyone’s needs equally and never pretend to know an answer when he didn’t. In another story he recounted helping to organise a citywide health outreach program: instead of issuing orders from his office, he would ride the bus to clinics, hand out flyers himself and ask nurses how best to reach families who’d never visited a doctor.

He also told me mistakes were just clues, not failures: if a solution didn’t work, that meant I was one step closer to the right fix. Best of all he always reminded me to stay calm when things got confusing, because a calm mind sees patterns faster than a panicking one.

That inspired me to set up my own “lab” at home, where I used colored beads to represent different investments and experimented with simple rules—saving more of one color when it went up in value, taking some off the board when it went down. Watching Uncle Ian budget his own family’s expenses by running his code made me appreciate that managing money isn’t just about numbers in a piggy bank but about understanding patterns, planning ahead, and even using a bit of smart technology to make better choices.",

He works long hours in finance yet never misses Alex’s football matches or his birthday celebrations with Duke, their Labrador. He carves out weekends for outings—sometimes a simple walk with Alex and Duke in the park—and treats those hours as sacred, not as an afterthought. He involves Alex in caring for Duke—teaching him to feed, walk and even groom the dog—so Alex feels responsible and they bond. He sets clear boundaries: work stays at the office, and home is for family. He also shares his own passions—like introducing Alex to financial concepts gently—so Alex learns alongside him rather than feeling ignored. From him I’ve learned that true balance isn’t about clocking equal hours for work and play but about giving your full attention to each when it counts, planning ahead to protect family moments, and sharing genuine interests so that work, play and care all become part of a shared life.",

He laughs about their arguments over colour—she prefers jewel-bright oils, he wants muted earth-tones—then how they always settle on a richer palette by combining both their ideas. When Samira mounted her first solo show at a local gallery, Irvin spent days in his studio making bespoke display panels, drilling in tiny LED lights she’d chosen to bring out the fine detail in her pattern work.

Other days we’d sit quietly, watching him carve tiny wooden totems or weave lengths of rope into miniature jungles, and I’d join by adding specks of paint or threading beads between leaves. He never corrected my mistakes but encouraged me to push each piece past its comfort zone: more blur, heavier texture, sharper angles. Sometimes he’d pause, hand me a tool—an ancient drill or a battered saw—and let me shape the next stage of his sculpture. In those hours I learned that creativity isn’t about perfect technique but about daring to try, to fail, to discover something new.

        "answer_en": "Samira showed me how to blend traditional sketching with digital finishing so my drawings feel both hand-made and crisp. First she taught me to start every piece with a loose pencil or pen sketch—capturing the shapes and posture of my subject without worrying about details—then scan or photograph it and import it into Procreate. There, she showed me how to use layers: one for clean line work, another for flat colors, and extra ones for shadows (using Multiply mode) and highlights (using Overlay). She taught me to experiment with custom brushes—some that mimic watercolor washes, some that look like pencil textures—so I can build rich surfaces without getting bogged down. She also introduced me to simple color-theory tricks: picking a warm accent color against a cool background, or using complementary pairs to make my characters “pop.” Finally, Samira encouraged me to borrow patterns from Persian art—stylized floral or geometric motifs—and tuck them into borders or clothing, which gives my work a unique twist. Ever since, I’ve used her layering method and brush techniques in every project, from my “Contact” installation to my digital nature sketches.",

        "answer_en": "When Samira and I team up on a piece it always feels like a conversation rather than one of us leading. Usually she’ll spread out jars of pigment in every shade she’s mixed and invite me to point out the two or three colors that speak to me most—sometimes I’ll surprise her by picking a dusty rose or a deep teal she hadn’t planned to use. Then I’ll sketch a few rough shapes on scrap paper—often inspired by the plants or insects I’ve been observing—while she watches, nods, then lightly traces over my lines to show me how they might flow into a final composition. Once we’ve settled on a palette and a basic layout, she shows me how to blend the paints, but I’m the one who presses the brush to the canvas and fills in the shapes with my own strokes. She never shuts down my ideas; instead she shares tips on how to make a hue glow or how to layer in texture, and I watch in awe as my simple sketches evolve into something richer. By the end, it feels like the painting is equally hers and mine—a true collaboration born from our different strengths.",

She showed me how mint’s roots spread underground like a hidden maze so we gave it its own pot; basil needed regular pinching back of its tips to make it bushy and keep flowering all summer. A few weeks later we set spring bulbs—daffodils and tulips—in neat lines, and Aunt Audrey explained that bulbs store everything they need to burst into color next year. In early summer we built a simple bean trellis from bamboo canes tied with string and watched runner beans climb toward the sun, teaching me that plants grow by reaching for light. We also tried propagating rosemary cuttings—stripping leaves from a stem, placing it in damp sand and waiting patiently for roots to form.

Watching him write simple programs in Python or JavaScript, I’ve learned about variables as named containers for information, and how to test and “debug” by finding and fixing mistakes just like solving a puzzle. On weekends he’s even helped me automate a toy robot’s movements, explaining how software engineers plan, write, test and refine code so it works reliably.

I helped by peeling and chopping the root vegetables for the roasting tray – carrots, parsnips and potatoes – and arranging them neatly around the meat so they cook in the lamb juices. Next he demonstrated making Yorkshire pudding batter: whisking eggs, flour and milk to just the right frothy consistency, and I took over the deafening hot tin to pour the batter in and pop it under the grill until each one rose into a golden, puffed parcel. He then showed me how to deglaze the roasting pan with red wine and stock to create a rich gravy, and I stirred it patiently until it was smooth and glossy. Edward also taught me to taste and adjust seasoning, explaining how a pinch more salt or a splash of acid can transform the flavor. After dinner I washed up the pans and utensils, learning proper kitchen hygiene and organization.

When he braised lamb shanks he slow-cooked them in stout and root veg from the nearby market, just as they do in his home pubs north of the Pennines. For pudding he revived a childhood favourite, the Manchester tart—sweet flaky pastry filled with raspberry jam and topped with coconut and custard. Even in simple breakfasts he’d serve bacon butties with a dollop of tangy Eccles cake jam, a nod to the old bakery stalls his grandparents loved on Sunday mornings.

He’s explained trend forecasting as a kind of detective work: watching what people choose on the street, online and in movies, then predicting which colours or textures will become popular next season. Daniele also talks about sustainability, experimenting with recycled fibres or zero-waste cutting so a single length of cloth can be cut into many pieces. He says designers at CSM learn to work quickly, sketching in ten minutes or using digital software to share ideas around the world.

From stories Grandpa George told me, she taught him three things that I’ve come to cherish myself.  First, the value of family togetherness: every Sunday she insisted on a big family meal—no excuses—so that no one ever felt overlooked or unimportant.  Second, the art of making do: she saved every scrap of fabric and bit of food, and taught Grandpa that you could turn the simplest ingredients into a feast if you cared enough.  And third, a deep respect for tradition: she passed down the “G-name” game, so that each of her children’s names began with the same letter, signing every birthday card with the lace-edged stationery she’d embroidered by hand.  Those lessons in hospitality, thrift and honoring the past were so important to Grandpa that he kept the Sunday Roast tradition alive—and now I, in turn, know that gathering around the table, wasting nothing and celebrating our roots are gifts Isabella’s generation passed down to all of us.",

From her, I learned that a forest isn’t silent but full of distant conversation; that floating above her kitchen once was no dream but a glimpse of that hidden dialogue; and that when I press my palm to tree bark or crouch beside a spider’s web, I am following the path she showed me—into the heart of the natural world.",

He spoke of waking before dawn to fetch coal for the kitchen stove and of ration books clipped to his mother’s coat during hard winters. He described long queues outside church halls for free soup, and how the whole family gathered every evening around a single oil lamp to listen to the wireless. At school, there was no running water—he’d carry a pail from the hand pump at morning break—and his playground was a muddy farm field. He learned to mend his own bicycle in a neighbor’s workshop because new parts were unaffordable. His tales always carried a sense of shared hardship, where neighbors depended on one another and nothing was wasted.\n\nBy contrast, my childhood is full of comforts he could hardly imagine. I wake up to an alarm, toast pops up in a toaster, and central heating chases away any chill.

The guppies flit around in little shoals, their tails flashing neon orange and blue when they chase each other in playful courtship dances, while the angelfish glide almost motionless, like graceful sailboats, fanning out their fins to explore every corner of the tank. At feeding time the guppies zoom up like a tiny tornado, then the angelfish drift in to pick at flakes with surprising gentleness. To keep their home healthy I check the water temperature every morning (around 25 °C), test pH and ammonia with a little kit, and do a 20–30 percent water change each week using a gravel vacuum so debris doesn’t pile up. I clean the filter media once a month in old tank water so I don’t kill the good bacteria, trim any overgrown java ferns, and feed them a mix of high-quality flakes, frozen brine shrimp, and the occasional bloodworm. That way the water stays clear, the fish stay active, and I get to enjoy their little underwater world every day.",

He taught me to change about a quarter of the water every week by siphoning out the cloudy water into a bucket and gently topping up with fresh, dechlorinated water. Dad also showed me how to clean the filter sponge without using soap so I didn’t kill the good bacteria that break down fish waste. I practised reading the numbers on the test strips until I could spot when something was off. My biggest challenge was an algae bloom last spring: the tank turned green in two days and the fish became sluggish. I had to learn to reduce light, check our tap’s hardness and adjust feeding so leftovers didn’t rot. Another time, an ammonia spike happened after I forgot to rinse a new decoration—I nearly lost a guppy until I did an emergency water change. Keeping water quality right meant paying attention every day to how the fish swam, testing regularly and not overloading the tank with too many fish or too much food.",

We keep the water at about 26 °C with a clear filter to mimic the warm, slow-moving streams of his homeland. Above the basking area there’s a UVB lamp and a heat lamp so he can stretch his limbs under a gentle sun-like glow, and we gently mist the land side every morning to maintain 60–70 % humidity, just like the rainy season along the Amazon’s edge. Inside I’ve packed in lush, hardy plants—Java fern, pennywort and creeping ivy—so he can explore and hide. Since we set this up, I’ve noticed he spends longer basking, sometimes tucking one leg up like he’s snoozing on a riverbank, then swims with a sudden burst of energy as if chasing small fish.

Leopard also spends more time exploring the terrarium at night, climbing on rocks and inspecting corners, while Cleopatra often opts to sit near her favorite basking spot or curl up under the faux bark shelter. In handling sessions Leopard will usually stay in one spot and let you stroke his back, but Cleopatra often darts away after a few seconds if she’s not in the mood. These little quirks mean Leopard’s favorite “snack” is a hefty cricket he can chase, whereas Cleopatra seems happiest when offered tiny dubia roaches or pinhead crickets she can nibble at her leisure.",

I had to study how to keep their tank at just the right temperature day and night, create a warm hideout for shedding, offer live insects on a careful feeding schedule, change water regularly and clean their enclosure without stressing them. I learned to watch their behavior closely—Leopard’s bursts of activity meant it was hunting time, Cleopatra’s slower movements meant she might be preparing for a shed.

        "answer_en": "Caring for a family of parakeets and their newly hatched chicks means juggling feeding routines, hygiene, social dynamics and health checks so that each bird thrives. First, diet can be a challenge: adults need a mix of high-quality pellets, fresh greens and occasional seeds, but chicks require warm, protein-rich “egg food” or soft seed gruel several times a day until they’re fledged. I prepare homemade mixes of hard-boiled egg yolk mashed with soaked seed and a tiny dash of fruit or finely chopped vegetables, offering it in a shallow dish where both parents and chicks can eat safely. Second, hygiene is vital: droppings build up quickly, so I line the cage floor with paper I change daily, scrub perches and feeders weekly with bird-safe disinfectant and ensure fresh water at all times to prevent bacterial or fungal growth. Third, temperature and draft control matter more for chicks: I cover half the nesting box with a soft cloth to trap warmth and position the cage away from cold windows or fans. Fourth, as birds are highly social, I watch for signs of bullying or stress—sometimes one parakeet guards the food—or when a chick is lagging behind the others; in that case I gently hand-feed or temporarily isolate it until it’s stronger. Finally, I monitor health by checking plumage, appetite and activity every morning; if a bird looks fluffed up or lethargic, I consult a vet without delay. By combining careful feeding, thorough cleaning, temperature control, social supervision and daily health checks, I keep my parakeets and chicks healthy and happy.",

Angry? Scared?”—and waited quietly while she found words; if she couldn’t yet, I offered guesses—“It seems like you’re upset because you miss Grandma’s stories,”—so she could learn to name her feelings; once she nodded or shook her head, I would say, “That makes sense,” to let her know her feelings were valid, then I’d share a small story of my own worry or excitement to show her she wasn’t alone, and finally we’d draw or build something together—sometimes a quick sketch of a storm cloud or a bright sun—so she could see that feelings change, and I’d remind her that whatever she felt was just one part of her day, not all of her.",

        "answer_en": "I find that the best way to help Luthien channel her urge to sprint is to turn running into a game. At home I often set up “cushion hurdles” down the hallway—she dashes over sofa cushions I’ve lined up, then it’s my turn, and we time each other to see who’s fastest. In the garden we play “rocket launch,” where I pick a tree or a garden gnome as the finish line and count down “3-2-1 blast off,” and she races me to it and back. At Hampstead Heath we use landmarks—“first to that big oak wins”—and she loves weaving between the trunks in a makeshift obstacle course. We also invent versions of tag like “statue tag,” where when I shout “statue!” she freezes in mid-stride until I say “go,” so she sprints, freezes, and sprints again, giggling all the way. Turning running into a playful challenge helps her burn off steam and keeps us both laughing.",

If he still wriggled, I’d suggest he count off the key points of the lesson on his fingers—“one gravity, two inertia, three action‐reaction”—and then draw each one in a box. This little game turned his impulse into a challenge: he could be as creative as he liked, but he had to capture the facts in pictures before bouncing back to his chatter. Sometimes I asked the teacher if he could help lead a five-minute “draw-and-tell” segment so Gerald felt in charge of his creativity.

We’d seen how fresh fruit and fragrant oils turned into cleansing bars and knew we wanted to try something unusual. Sitting at his chopping board, we tossed around ideas. I remembered how Dad always brewed coffee in the mornings and saved the grounds; Gerald’s mum loved rose-petal sachets; I still had that small bag of oatmeal from home; we argued briefly over whether to add mint leaves from Gerald’s garden. In the end we agreed on coffee grounds, oatmeal and a handful of crushed pink rose petals—each ingredient had to reflect something we loved or someone we knew. We carefully measured olive oil, coconut oil and lye under Gerald’s mum’s watchful eye, whisked until the mixture thickened into a custardy trace, then gently folded in our chosen additions. As the soap rested in its mold for the next forty-eight hours, we cleaned up the drips and lingering scent of lye, marveling at how our simple cooking-style brainstorming had produced something that really felt like \"ours.\" When we unmolded the first bar a couple of days later, rough-edged and flecked with dark brown and pale pink, we beamed with pride.

Dad nearly choked on his tea laughing, Mom slapped her knee and hooted applause, Luthien leapt up and down cheering, and I felt like bursting with pride and astonishment at John’s talent and fearless showmanship.

I remember feeling a hollow ache in my chest when I walked into school without my usual routine, and John told me he feels the same emptiness when he wonders what his mother is doing or what his favourite Xi’an snack tastes like. The advice I give him is something I wish someone had given me: bring a little piece of home with you—his bamboo calligraphy brush or a favourite Zhengzhou magazine—and keep it on your bedside table so that when you miss home you can touch it and remember why you’re here. I’ve shown John how to carve out a “China corner” on my desk where he can leave postcards and draw maps of Xi’an; in return, he taught me how to whisper “ni hao” and “xie xie” properly, which made me feel closer to his world. We schedule a video‐call every Wednesday evening with his parents so that a familiar voice reaches him, and I taught him how to make simple whole wheat toast with Bonne Maman marmalade—he adapted it with a bit of Chinese tea instead of butter, and sharing it with us seemed to soothe him. When he’s missing home I tell him to join our family routines—help fold the laundry, water the plants, read aloud a page from his storybook—because small, ordinary tasks can turn a strange house into somewhere you belong. Finally, I tell him that just as I grew used to the laughter echoing down the school corridor, he’ll grow used to the footsteps on our creaky stairs, and soon this will feel less like someone else’s house and more like his own.",

He showed me on his atlas how that mountain ridge really divides China’s climate and culture into two whole halves, like an invisible line drawn by nature. Hearing that made me rush for our big wall map at home, trace every bend of those rivers and every peak of the range with my finger, then borrow a children’s book on Chinese geography from the mobile library so I could learn about the valley towns, the terraced farms along the foothills and how the Silk Road snaked out of that basin to the west.

When we tackle geography, I chalk a map on the pavement and hide flashcards under each country; every time he finds a card he must read the capital in English to win a point. If he struggles with a sentence, I suggest we sing it to the tune of one of his favourite songs, because John loves to sing and that helps him remember the words. For grammar, I’ll write a funny story with blanks and we fill them in together, choosing verbs and adjectives as if picking toppings for a pizza. I also let him teach me a few Chinese characters in return—he beams with pride and relaxes when his knowledge is respected.

Sometimes I’d make stone-baked cakes (Shizi Mo) on a griddle and we’d pull them apart, laughing at the crackle, as he explained how they bake them back home.

To help her bring that dream to life, I gathered some slender twigs from the garden to serve as tiny “forest branches,” taught her how to weave the yarn petals in moonlit hues, and we fastened the finished flowers onto the twigs. Then we painted a small wooden disk with a glowing moon motif, attached a battery‐powered LED behind it to cast a soft glow, and mounted the whole arrangement on a circular base.

We lay out a 24-colour wooden pencil set for fine lines and subtle shading, a small tin of oil pastels for rich, bold swathes of colour, and a pan of water-colours for washes that blend unpredictably when we drip extra water on them. I always bring my handkerchief to wipe brushes or fingers, and she brings a scrap of waxed cardboard for mixing pastel crumbs into smoky tones. We choose those materials because pencils let us capture tiny details—like the veins in a leaf or the curve of a petal—while oil pastels give us that sudden burst of brightness when we want to show sunlight. Water-colours teach us to embrace surprise: a spill becomes a cloud, a gradient becomes shadow. Together we share ideas—she’ll start a dreamy flower in pastel, and I’ll outline it in pencil or add a translucent water-colour glaze over it—so our pieces feel like something between her dreams and my observations.

In kite flying, we treated the wide expanse of Hampstead Heath like our laboratory—Leslie would tinker with tails and bridle points on his traditional swallow kite to see how many loops it could hold before spinning out, while I experimented with varying spine lengths and crossbars. The hardest design we ever tackled together was a self-supporting, six-cell box kite made of carbon dowels and ultralight ripstop nylon; every cell had to be perfectly square and the frames aligned to millimeter precision or the whole thing twisted in the wind.

He urged me to look for patterns first—if adding 7 + 8 felt tricky, he’d say “Watch how 7 + 7 works, then just add one more!”—and to color-code steps with different pencils so I could track my reasoning. He turned long multiplication into a race against the clock, suggesting we time ourselves with a timer and try to beat our previous record instead of stressing about mistakes. When geometry tripped me up, he encouraged me to draw the shapes physically with sticks or string, to see them with my hands. And whenever I got stuck, Leslie would propose we invent a short story around the problem—“If two knights collect apples from 8 trees each, how many apples altogether?”—so I was thinking about dragons and orchards instead of feeling anxious. By turning every exercise into a playful challenge and breaking problems into small, colorful, real-world steps, Leslie helped me see that math wasn’t just right or wrong but a series of adventures to enjoy.",

On another afternoon we’d meet at my house for Rummikub tournaments, with hot soda crackers on the side, or we’d experiment in my kitchen, whipping up soap with coffee grounds or attempting bread recipes from my Iranian cookbook. Weekends often meant early birdwatching sessions with my 10× binoculars, spotting robins and sparrowhawks, or museum trips where we’d pore over dinosaur bones and fossils until closing time.

Whenever he tried to bend a rule or hesitated about drawing a tile, I paused and quietly reminded him that melds must have at least three tiles and that if you can’t play, you must draw. I even jotted the key steps on a scrap of paper—“lay three or more in sequence or matching numbers,” “draw if you can’t play,” “take turns in order”—and kept it by his side. I explained that the real fun was in rearranging the table together, but it only worked if we both followed the same rules, and that fairness is as important as winning.

When we switched to his bicycle a few weeks later, I borrowed my helmet and knee pads for him and ran alongside, barely touching the back of his saddle to steady him while he pedaled.

After the lions we head to the meerkat habitat: David explained how meerkats take turns as “sentries,” perching on their hind legs to scan for eagles and jackals while the rest of the mob forages, and how their warning chirps differ subtly depending on the kind of danger.

With Amanda by my side, I feel braver about trying new recipes, and I know that even if things go sideways, she’ll have a clever fix or at least a laugh to keep me from giving up.

I’d always thought you simply poured and waited, but Amanda explained that each cup of broth must be absorbed before adding the next, and that scraping the bottom of the pan releases the tiny browned bits that give risotto its nutty flavor. She even let me taste a pinprick of saffron steeped in hot water—just the smell made me understand why it’s so prized.

Jenny, being a couple of years older and more confident with a knife, prefers the chopping—she’s careful yet swift with onions and peppers, and she says she enjoys the precision and the satisfying “clack‐clack” sound. If Jenny ever wants a break from chopping, she’ll hand me the chopping board and I’ll grate or slice under her supervision, and if I ever tire of stirring she’s happy to pick up the whisk. Sometimes, when neither of us has a strong preference, we flip a wooden spoon like a coin just for fun, and whoever “wins” chooses first—but more often than not we match the task to the skill and energy we each feel that day.",

At home I tried some of her training exercises: I set up a makeshift agility ladder with chalk on the patio and hopped through the rungs as fast as I could, then practiced bouncing a tennis ball repeatedly against the garage wall to sharpen my hand-eye coordination. I even swung my foam racket at a balloon to work on control without worrying about missing. I wasn’t as quick or precise as Rosa, but just as she did, I learned that every drill, however simple, helped me feel a little more like a champion.",

I share a small joke or ask about his favourite animal—“Hey, have you seen any penguins at the zoo lately?”—to take his mind off the pressure. If he’s hesitating to try something new, I offer to do it alongside him—“Let’s both draw a robot together and see whose looks more like our classmate Colin”—so it feels more like a game than a test.

One month I brought in Chinese kites, another time I learned about Irish soda bread—and every time I discovered things I’d never even thought to ask about before. \n\nThen he teamed up with the science teacher and took us out into the school’s little garden for “Nature Detectives” days. We built simple bug hotels, pond-dipped to see water creatures under the microscope and recorded which insects visited which flowers. Holding a ladybird in one hand and a notebook in the other made me realise that biology wasn’t just a list of facts in a book but something you could explore and experiment with yourself.

Teachers used colourful visuals and hands-on resources so that the four- and five-year-olds could stay interested, then gradually increased the difficulty so the ten- and eleven-year-olds could tackle longer writing tasks or solve maths problems in pairs. I especially loved how sometimes the older children became helpers, guiding the younger ones through drawing or reading activities; I felt proud explaining a tricky word to a five-year-old or showing an eight-year-old how to share paints fairly. What I enjoyed most about that wide age range was watching everyone learn from each other: the littlest faces brightened whenever they copied an older friend, and the eldest felt grown-up when they offered a helping hand, so our classroom felt more like a big family than a group of isolated ages.",
        "answer_ch": "因为我们的学校从四岁教到十一岁，课堂活动必须适应不同的学习阶段：早上我们可能会用生动的歌曲和运动游戏开始，以帮助最小的孩子学习字母和基本的计数，之后年长的孩子会分成小组，进行更复杂的故事或科学实验，而最年轻的孩子则用图片卡片练习拼读。老师们使用丰富多彩的视觉辅助材料和动手资源，让四岁和五岁的孩子保持兴趣，然后逐渐增加难度，以便十岁和十一岁的孩子可以进行更长的写作任务或两人合作解决数学问题。我特别喜欢的是，有时年长的孩子会成为助手，引导年轻的孩子进行绘画或阅读活动；我为向五岁的孩子解释一个难懂的词或向八岁的孩子展示如何公平地分享颜料而感到自豪。我最喜欢这个广泛年龄段的原因是看到每个人相互学习：最小的孩子在模仿年长的朋友时脸上洋溢着光彩，而最大的孩子在提供帮助时感觉自己变得成熟，因此我们的课堂更像是一个大家庭，而不是一个孤立年龄的群体。",

In Key Stage 2 I build on those foundations by reading longer chapter books, writing my own multi-paragraph stories, multiplying and dividing larger numbers, learning fractions and decimals, conducting science experiments on electricity and sound, studying the water cycle and classifying living things, interpreting maps with grid references, programming simple stories on the computer and even using more complex tools in design and technology. What excites me most is tackling new challenges such as mastering all my times-tables so I can solve multistep problems in seconds, planning and running my own science investigation from hypothesis to conclusion, writing persuasive essays on historical events, presenting a project at Art Week, debating world issues in PSHE, leading a group in our multicultural festival and learning to weld and drill parts to build my own bookcase—each of these pushes me to use everything I learned before in clever new ways and discover skills I never knew I had.",

        "answer_en": "Last Art Week I discovered that paint was my favourite medium because it allowed me to move faster than clay or pencils ever could. In Uncle Owen’s studio I gathered jars of acrylic and squeezed colours onto scraps of cardboard or canvas boards then flung and smeared them with my hands, spoons, or even a twig until shapes and patterns emerged that surprised me. Painting felt wild and free, as if the energy inside me poured out in streaks of red, blue, and yellow, and no brush stroke was ever wrong. I tried modelling clay too, but clay asked me to be neat and precise, whereas paint celebrated my biggest feelings in one glorious splatter. I still keep a corner in the studio marked “my space” and cover it in every colour I could find.",

I suspended a dozen hand-painted cloud shapes from the gallery ceiling using clear fishing line and brushed them with pearly silver and pale blue highlights so they seemed to glow under the lights. On each cloud I drew tiny pencil sketches of what I remembered seeing from above—everyone’s heads, the heater by which Orla sat, even the spiral staircase—and attached small speakers that played my whispered question, “Where do you wish to return?” when visitors reached up and gently tapped them. The project was memorable because it transformed a private, surreal memory into a shared dream-like experience and invited people to explore their own feelings about home, memory and the pull of gravity.",

Seeing it stretched across the lawn felt like discovering a giant silver cocoon in the middle of our school grounds. Walking into it, I felt my heart pound with wonder and a little trepidation, as though I were stepping into someone’s secret dream.

To prepare I spent afternoons in Owen’s studio fashioning my own wings from wire and painted card, I practised buzzing and “landing” motions in the garden so they looked smooth, and each evening I stood in front of Dad and recited my short lines—“Without bees there’d be no apples!”—until I had them perfectly memorised and could say them loudly without forgetting a word.

I’d helped Jessica prepare it at home, but tasting it alongside everyone else that day made it feel even more special. I also couldn’t resist sampling a bowl of Tom Yum soup from the Thai booth and a few pieces of Turkish baklava from another stall – the zing of the chilli and lemongrass in the Tom Yum was completely new to me, and the honeyed sweetness of the baklava was a delightful surprise!",

Once our stall was set up on the lawn, I ladled the rich soup over torn chunks of flatbread, stacking bowls on a warming tray. As the queue formed I switched to serving mode, balancing two bowls at a time, greeting each guest with a small bow and a quick, “This one’s lamb pao mo—hearty, warm, full of onions and cumin.” Between pouring broth and counting change I shifted into storyteller mode, telling curious shoppers about how the dish comes from Xi’an’s winding alleys, how its soft bread soaks up the broth, and how each spoonful was inspired by Chen Jia’s family recipe back home in Shaanxi.

        "answer_en": "My favorite part of Easter Sunday is the egg hunt—there’s something about scouring the garden for hidden treasures that makes me feel like a tiny explorer mapping uncharted territory. I love the moment I spot a brightly painted egg tucked beneath a rosebush or nestled in the crook of a low branch, the same thrill I feel when I discover a rare beetle or peek at a nest through my binoculars. Once the hunt ends, though, I savor our family meal almost as much: the way the lamb soup warms my hands, the careful ceremony of passing plates, and the laughter that fills the room as we compare our finds. And attending the church celebration early in the morning ties it all together—a quiet chance to reflect before the day’s adventures—so really, it’s the hunt that sets the whole day in motion, and everything that follows feels even richer because of it.",
        "answer_ch": "我最喜欢复活节星期天的部分是寻找彩蛋——在花园里寻找隐藏的宝藏让我感觉像一位微小的探险家，在未知的领域中探索。我喜欢在玫瑰灌木下或低树枝的弯处发现一个色彩鲜艳的彩蛋的那一刻，那种发现稀有甲虫或通过望远镜窥视鸟巢时的兴奋感一样。不过，一旦寻找结束，我同样享受我们全家的餐顿：羔羊汤温暖我的双手，传递盘子的细致仪式，以及我们在比较收获时充满欢笑的房间。清晨参加教会的庆祝活动将这些都联系在一起——在一天的冒险之前，安静地反思的机会——所以，实际上，正是这个寻找活动开启了整个星期天，之后的一切因为这个活动而显得更加丰富。",

Lying on the grass with Lucien, I watched woodpeckers and sparrowhawks through my binoculars while Dad and Mum relaxed under the shade of an oak.

I admired Rafael Nadal’s style most of all because on clay he moves like it’s part of him—he slides into every shot with incredible balance, digs balls out from impossible angles, and never seems to lose belief even when the rallies stretch on forever. His heavy topspin forehand felt almost magical as it dipped low over the net and kicked up high, and every time he pumped his fist after a point I felt I’d just witnessed something heroic. Though I’d given up playing tennis myself, watching Nadal made me remember why I fell in love with the sport in the first place: it’s about tenacity, grace under pressure, and treating every point as worth fighting for.",

I pack my notebook, binoculars and hammer with reverent care and spend hours poking in rock pools for ichthyosaur bones, then at night pitch our tent under the Milky Way in the New Forest, waiting for the Perseid meteors to streak overhead. Devon means freedom: building sandcastle laboratories, tasting Mum’s picnics by hidden coves, and watching Dad’s face light up at every new fossil discovery. No lie-ins or backyard games ever bring me closer to summer than those first mornings in Devon, where every sunrise is a fresh invitation to explore, learn and feel utterly, wonderfully alive.",

I’d never felt such a thrill, as though I’d unearthed a real treasure from the deep past, and it made me imagine Mary Anning herself cheering me on. The new experience wasn’t just finding a fossil but using proper tools: I learned how to angle the hammer, chip away safely and patiently, and marvel at the tiny fragments that told a story of creatures older than dinosaurs. It felt like stepping into a real-life adventure, and afterward, tucked into my tent by the waves, I couldn’t stop thinking about how much more there must be waiting to be discovered.",

I love clapping my hands to coax Leopard and Cleopatra the geckos out from under their rocks and giggling as Cotton-tail and I share carrot sticks on the lawn.  I’ll bring my notebook to sketch the bright yellow parrots and watch beetles explore the flowerbeds.  Every time I’m there I beg Grandma to let me snip a few roses for my room and help Grandpa pull up weeds in his vegetable patch so we can taste the first tomatoes.  And of course the best moment is gathering at their big oak table for Sunday roast—Grandpa’s lamb soup, Grandma’s steamed greens and the crackling potato roast—they somehow taste even better in the fresh country air.

I spend the walk talking Dad’s ear off about whatever new insect or bird I’ve spotted that week, and he listens, occasionally pointing out a tuft of feathers or a curious beetle. After a good hour of cloud-watching or butterfly-chasing, we’ll find a little café or tearoom—maybe the one near the zoo—for scones and Devonshire cream, and Dad always lets me pick the jam. Sometimes, if the weather’s right, we detour to fly a kite on Parliament Hill. Other weekends we’ll wander into the Natural History Museum to see the ichthyosaur—or try a streetside cooking class together, experimenting with pancakes or even a new soup recipe.

PSHE at the end of the day helps me unwind by giving me space to talk about how I feel, learn ways to manage worries and to understand other people’s perspectives, so by the time I leave school I’m not just buzzing from science but also calmer, clearer and ready to go home with a plan for any worries that popped up during the day.",

Balancing the two means using Religion to centre my thoughts and slow my breath, and then using PE to shake off any mental cobwebs and fill my body with energy—between the two, it’s definitely PE that makes me feel most alive, sending endorphins through my legs and turning every muscle into a cheerful buzz.",

We might pretend to be explorers in a jungle, knights defending a castle or even gossiping cats in a family of mice—nothing is too silly. I love the way we all burst into laughter as we try out our wildest ideas and see them tumble into farcical reality.

But my favorite piece was the enormous mixed-media “Tree of Time” by Ms Phyllis Yang—a cross-section of an ancient oak painted in deep browns and metallic gold leaf that caught the light just so.

The hush of the gallery, the way the light played across the walls, even the smell of old wood floors made me feel like I’d stepped inside someone’s imagination. In computer class we learn to type and click through code, and in science lessons we follow precise steps to test or measure things, but in the gallery I sketched ideas on the spot, let my eyes drift over shapes and details, and felt my own ideas bubbling up.

Most mornings I craft whole-wheat toast, medium-baked, topped with marmalade, or I fry an egg after practicing my technique. Mum joins me if I’m tackling something tricky—like when I first burned my finger making eggs—and offers guidance on heat and timing.

With Sophie on Fridays I sat at her cozy kitchen table, drinking from real mugs, nibbling her homemade scones and talking about things that mattered—her studies, my week, even her accident and how she felt afterward. It was calm, warm and unhurried, and I loved that Sophie, unlike classmates I chat with between lessons, always listened as if what I said really mattered.

If it’s Mom, she’ll tell me about a tricky case at the clinic or a funny thing a patient said, and I’ll compare her day with mine, trading stories over who had the more surprising discovery.

I get a vote too; I’ll recommend masala curry chicken if I’ve been reading about spices all week. We talk through our choices—will this go well for leftovers?
