      "question": "What’s your full name, and do you know why your parents chose it for you?",
      "answer": "2025（8—9岁）-05-28-周三  \nEnglish Entry:  \n\nMy full name was Isaac Newton.  I discovered early on that I shared not only my birthday—December 25—but also my name with the famous scientist Sir Isaac Newton.  Dad always said he and Mum chose it because he admired Sir Isaac’s spirit of discovery and because the calendar showed the same date in 1642.  They hoped I would inherit his curiosity and courage to ask big questions about the world.  \n\nWhen I first learned I had the same name, I felt proud and a little puzzled—could I really live up to such a name?  Mum told me that, in Chinese belief, sharing a great name could bring a good omen, and in Christian tradition my being born on Christmas Day made my name doubly significant.  Dad added that every time he called me “Isaac Newton,” it reminded him to see me not just as their little boy but as someone with a bright mind and a hopeful future.  \n\nI liked that idea.  Even though I wasn’t sure I would uncover gravity or build a telescope, I resolved to honour my name by never stopping asking “why?” and by always exploring with wonder.",

          "question": "Why does that matter to you?",
          "answer": "It’s important to me because I like my diary to be as true and complete a picture of my life as I can make it. I’m still young, and I know I’ll forget names, dates, little habits and feelings if I don’t write them down. Having all those details—who my friends are, what my parents and uncles do, where I go each day—helps me remember exactly how I felt and what happened. Writing it all out not only keeps my memories clear, it makes my diary more honest and useful when I look back on it years from now."
        },
        {
          "question": "How did you feel when that happened?",
          "answer": "I felt a burst of excitement the moment I spotted that little rainbow on the stairwell wall. My heart raced, and a warm thrill ran through me—like I’d discovered a hidden treasure. In that instant I knew Chen Jia had truly become part of our family, and I couldn’t help smiling from ear to ear."

        {
          "question": "What memories come up when you think of that?",
          "answer": "Dear Diary,  \n\nWhen I thought about all those people and places today, a handful of bright memories came rushing back:  \n\n• The day I first pressed my face against the glass at the Natural History Museum, staring up at that ichthyosaur skull and begging my parents to move to Dorset. I remembered how my heart thumped so hard I thought it would burst.  \n\n• The two-week holiday we finally spent in Dorset when I was five—the granite cliffs of Durdle Door glowed in the sun, and I felt like I was living inside a storybook.  \n\n• The evening I flung paint all over Owen’s studio wall in a furious burst of colour. I had never felt so freed from anger and surprise before.  \n\n• Floating above the room in Ireland, hearing Great-Grandma Orla tell me to “come back” before slipping into my stroller again—I still don’t know if it was a dream, but I know it changed me.  \n\n• The first time I told Mom and Dad about seeing Hassor, their tears of relief and pride, and how I woke the next morning feeling as light as a bird.  \n\n• The day Gerald and I rescued that squirrel together on Hampstead Heath—me with my handkerchief and him speechless with astonishment. That was when we became best friends.  \n\nEach memory felt like a little flame lighting up my mind all over again. Even the sad ones—like losing Peter—have their place, reminding me how much I loved him. All these moments weave together into the wonderful, strange tapestry of my life so far.  \n\nIsaac"

        {
          "question": "Which part of that stands out most in your mind?",
          "answer": "The moment that stands out most in my mind was the night I finally told Mum and Dad about seeing Hassor.  \n\nI remembered how I crept into their room, my heart pounding, and told them everything—how I’d first met him in my dream, how Orla had called his name. At first they just listened in silence. Then Dad’s eyes filled with tears, and Mum began to cry too. They held me tight and told me they believed me.  \n\nI’d carried that secret like a heavy stone in my chest for days, but after Mum and Dad’s tears, it felt as if that weight had lifted. I fell asleep between them for the first time in years, and for the first time I woke up feeling light instead of afraid.  \n\nThat night made me understand how much I could trust my parents—and how extraordinary our world might really be."

        {
          "question": "What do you notice about yourself when you remember that?",
          "answer": "When I remember telling Mum and Dad about Hassel, I notice my hands trembling at first, as if I were holding a small bird that might fly away. My heart felt both heavy—with the secret I’d carried—and then suddenly so light, as though a great weight had lifted. I remember my cheeks burning with both fear and excitement, and how my voice wobbled before steadying itself.  \n\nI notice, too, that when I look back on that moment, I feel a warm glow of pride—pride that I could be brave enough to speak the truth, and relieved that Mum and Dad believed me. It shows me that I’m someone who worries about keeping secrets, but also values honesty and the comfort of sharing wonders with the people I trust most."

        {
          "question": "What questions pop into your head about that now?",
          "answer": "I’ve been thinking over everything I’ve written and certain questions keep popping into my head:\n\n1. Who exactly is Hassel and why has he chosen to show himself to me?  \n2. If Great-Grandma Orla saw Hassel too, how many other members of my family—or even people in the world—have met him?  \n3. What is the true meaning of that silver-glowing “Light of the Elves” flower, and why did Orla warn me it would guide me?  \n4. Where does that endless library of spiral staircases live—was it really a place in another realm, or only in my dreams?  \n5. Can dreams really carry me to other worlds, or are they windows into truths my waking mind cannot yet grasp?  \n6. Will I ever find tangible proof—like the Society for Psychical Research seems to seek—for things I’ve seen and felt?  \n7. As I grow older, will my interest in the natural world and my wish to become a doctor lead me to uncover more of these mysteries, or will they remain secrets just beyond my reach?"

          "question": "How has that shaped who you are today?",
          "answer": "2026（9—10岁）-02-05-周四\n\nI have been thinking a lot about how seeing Hassel and telling my parents changed me. At first, I felt scared and secretive—afraid that no one would understand. But when I finally shared everything, and saw Mum and Dad’s tears of relief and belief, I discovered two very important things about myself.\n\nFirst, I learned I am braver than I thought. I used to hide my strange experiences, convinced they would make me look odd. But once I spoke up, I realized that being honest about what I see and feel gives me strength. Now, I’m less afraid to ask difficult questions—about aliens, about life, and even about why I exist. I know that true courage is not the absence of fear, but choosing to face it anyway.\n\nSecond, I understood how much I need my family’s support. When Mum whispered that she and Dad would always believe me, my heart felt lighter than air. Their trust has become the foundation of my confidence. I now feel I can explore mysteries—be they in the night sky or in my own dreams—knowing I have a safety net of love at home.\n\nThese discoveries have shaped me into a more curious and confident boy. I still want to investigate every wonder—alien or not—but I no longer feel alone in my quest. I carry with me the certainty that sharing my journey makes it richer, and that together with my family, I can turn the world’s greatest mysteries into adventures we face as one."

        {
          "question": "What surprised you most about that experience?",
          "answer": "What surprised me most was not the secret itself, but my parents’ reaction when I finally told them. I had expected confusion or disbelief, even a scolding, but instead they both burst into tears of relief and joy. Dad cried as he told me he’d always believed Grandma Orla, and Mom hugged me so tightly, thanking me for sharing everything. In that moment I realized how deeply they trust and love me—and that belief, so wholehearted and without question, was the most unexpected and wonderful surprise of all."
        },
        {
          "question": "What lesson, if any, did you learn from it?",
          "answer": "I learned that holding something wonderful and strange in my heart—like my secret meeting with Hassor—can feel like a heavy weight pressing on my every thought. Only when I trusted my parents enough to tell them did I feel that burden lift and my world grow brighter again. That taught me that honesty with the people who love you most isn’t scary—it’s the very thing that sets you free."

          "question": "How do you think this will matter to you in a year or ten years?",
          "answer": "日期：2025-04-26-周五  \nEnglish Entry:  \n\nYesterday I wrote about feeling so bored that nothing in the world seemed interesting. Today I thought about how that moment might matter to me in a year—or even in ten years.  \n\nA year from now I expect I’ll have found new hobbies or projects to chase away boredom—perhaps I will be training for a school swimming gala or mastering a new language. I think I’ll look back and remember that strange restless day as a turning point: the moment I realised that restlessness can be a signal to try something different, like running with Dad or returning to art at Owen’s studio.  \n\nTen years from now, I will be almost nineteen and perhaps at university or starting work. I might be buried in exams or research and feel that same itch of boredom again. If I do, I hope I’ll recall this spring, when my parents taught me that it’s okay to be bored—sometimes it’s just life’s way of nudging you toward the next adventure. I imagine myself then, grateful for having learned early on to listen to that feeling, and ready to turn it into curiosity, creativity, or a new challenge."

      "question": "How does it feel to be nine years old—what’s the best thing about this age?",
      "answer": "2025（8—9岁）-05-28-周三  \nEnglish Entry:  \nBeing nine felt like waking up on Christmas morning every day. Crossing the threshold from eight to nine gave me a quiet confidence—nothing dramatic, just a steady knowing that I could handle more of the world on my own. I noticed it first when I cooked breakfast for the family without help, and Dad actually said, “Well done, chef,” as if I’d earned a new title.  \n\nI felt more responsible: I managed my own pocket money, choosing whether to save for fossil specimens or spend a few pounds on a jar of marmalade. At school, I wasn’t just Isaac, the curious kid who knows a lot about beetles and butterflies—I was Isaac, the boy who’d shared a secret with his parents and lived to tell the tale. That made me feel trusted and grown-up.  \n\nThe best thing about being nine is that I could still chase cloud shapes in the park, lie on the grass with binoculars, and dream of flying like a falcon—while also planning real adventures, like making soap with Gerald or cooking lamb pao mo with Chen Jia’s mom. Nine is the age where imagination and independence finally hold hands: I’m old enough to try new things by myself, yet young enough to believe anything might happen. And every evening, when I climb into bed, I fall asleep eager for tomorrow’s discoveries.",

          "question": "What inspired you to say that?",
          "answer": "I said it because I was thinking back to that afternoon in Uncle Owen’s studio—when I’d had that big argument at school and was still furious as I walked in. He showed me that corner of his workspace and left me alone with all those jars of paint. I flung colour at a blank canvas until every bit of rage and energy just exploded out of me. \n\nThat first moment of splattering paint—of realising I could turn my anger into something alive on the canvas—made me feel like I truly understood what it meant to be an artist. Remembering how liberating that felt inspired me to say I was a “true artist.”"

I’d been buzzing with questions about Hassel and my dream of Great-Grandma, but I couldn’t think of anyone I trusted enough to tell—until I remembered how my mum believed in Orla, and how safe I’d felt in their arms when I was frightened. \n\nWhen I finally shared it with Mum and Dad, their tears and their belief made me feel lighter than I’ve ever felt. It mattered to me because at eight years old, the world already feels full of mysteries—and knowing I don’t have to carry them alone makes every wonder I discover that much more joyful."
